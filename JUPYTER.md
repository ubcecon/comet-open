# Jupyter Configuration

For this project, we will be using Jupyter notebooks.  You can access and develop via the UBC JupyterHub, which can be found at:

<url goes here>

We recommend, in general, that you should develop on the cloud hub unless that is impossible.  We also recommend using JupyterLab to develop and JupyterNotebook to test or debug.

## It's not working!

If you can't connect to the hub, or it keeps failing, try the following steps, retrying the JupyterHub after each step:

1.  If the kernel is running, shut it down, then restart your notebook.
2.  Close your browser (entirely) then re-open the hub, then go to step 1.
3.  Clear your cookies, try again, then go to step 2.
4.  Reboot your PC, try again, then go to step 3.

If these do not resolve the issue, contact <email address for CTLT here>, and CC <jonathan.graves@ubc.ca> in your email.

* Ensure you clearly identify the issue, and outline the steps you took to resolve it before contacting support.

## Kernel Configuration

When you are working on the hub, we use the following kernels:

* R (`irkernel`) kernel version: 1.3
    * R version 4.1.2
* Python (`ipykernel`) kernel version: 6.13.0
    * Python version 3.9.10
    * iPython 8.1.1

It is also possible to develop locally, if you do not wish to use the server.  To do use, you should ensure you have the same kernel version, and the following standard libraries installed:
