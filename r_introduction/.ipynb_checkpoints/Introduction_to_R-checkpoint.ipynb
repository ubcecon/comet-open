If you are familiar with other programming languages, such as Python, this will likely be very familiar - if this is your first time, don't be intimidated!  Try to play around with the examples and exercises as you work through this notebook; it's easiest to learn R (or any programming language) by playing around with it."

    "## Basic Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, it's important to get a good grasp of the different **data types** in R and how to use them.  Whenever with work with R, we will be manipulating different kinds of information, which is referred to as \"data\".  Data comes in many different forms, which define how we can use it in calculations or visualizations - these are called _types_ in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "R has 6 basic data types. Data types are used to store information about a variable or object in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Character**: data in text format, like \"word\" or \"abc\"\n",
    "2. **Numeric** (real or decimal): data in real number format, like 6, or 18.8 (referred to as **Double** in R)\n",
    "3. **Integer**:  data in an whole number (integer) format, like 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)\n",
    "4. **Logical**: truth values, like TRUE, FALSE\n",
    "5. **Complex**: data in complex (i.e. imaginary) format, like 1+6i (where $i$ is the $\\sqrt{-1}$)\n",
    "6. **Raw**: an unusual data type which we will not cover in this section\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are ever wondering what kind of type an object in R has, or what its properties are, we can use the following two functions, which allow us to examine the data type and elements contained within an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `typeof()`: this function returns a character string that corresponds to the data type of an object \n",
    "* `str()`: this function displays a compact internal structure of an R object \n",

Data structures in R programming are more complicated, as they are tools for holding multiple values. However, some of them are very important, and are worth discussing here. \n",

    "* **Dataframe**: a collection of vectors or lists, organized into rows and columns according to observations.\n",

In your project, although the functionality of the method `a + b` is obvious, it may be unclear what this operation's purpose is in your project. Your readers or other developers may ask: why did you use addition instead of multiplication or division? With comments, you can explain why this particular method was used for this particular code block and how it relates to other code blocks. \n",
