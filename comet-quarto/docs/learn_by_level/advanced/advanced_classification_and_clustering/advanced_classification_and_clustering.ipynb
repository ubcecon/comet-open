        "Many statistical models deal exclusively with data that is quantitative (numerical) in nature.  For example, a comparison of means ($t$-test) might evaluate the difference in _average_ incomes of two groups: a quantitative measure.  However, many questions of interest involve trying to predict _qualitative_ outcomes: will a person be arrested or not? Which university degree will they pursue?  Answering these kinds of questions requires us to predict the qualities an individual will have, which in statistics is called **classification** (the process of placing observations into distinct categories based on certain traits).\n",

        "## Key Issues in Clustering\n",
        "\n",
        "Our `kmeans` function above appeared to pretty cleanly classify our 100 points into 2 groups. In applications, we can think of this as the algorithm taking the values of continuous variables for all available data points to create a categorical, or qualitative, variable with 2 distinct values, indicative of the three clustered groups found among all of our data. In this way, the algorithm can allow us to \"find\" groupings within our data that are not even apparent to us at first glance.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are methods of clustering other than the $k$-means clustering technique, such as the hierarchical clustering technique mentioned earlier. However, the $k$-means approach is the most intuitive and by far most common technique used in machine learning to classify observations. Additionally, there are other versions of this algorithm which change how the cluster points (centers) are computed, such as using the `median` of all points within a cluster to find each cluster point; however, these approaches are conceptually similar to using the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, you may be wondering what the end of goal of clustering actually is. We used the $k$-means algorithm to group our 100 observations into 2 clusters above, but how do we know whether this is a good classification? Are our results worthy of being presented, or is there a better way to cluster these points? Perhaps we can tweak our approach to get clusters which are compact, that is, clusters which don't have wide variation from their mean cluster point. This is where that seemingly arbitrary choice of $K$ from earlier comes in.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Choosing $K$\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps the most important decision when doing k-means clustering is the selection of $K$, the number of clusters. Choice of this value, while it may seem arbitrary, is actually critical in ensuring that our clustering is accurate. The goal when choosing a value for $K$ is to minimize the sum of within-cluster variation across all clusters. This means creating $K$ clusters so that the individual points within each cluster are as close to the center point of that cluster as possible. \n",
        "\n",
        "An extremely bad value for $K$ is 1. With one cluster, there is actually no clustering occurring at all, so the total variance of all data points from their mean value is as large as possible. Increasing the value of $K$ allows for an increasing number of clusters, so that all available data points are crowded into increasingly small groups with consistently shrinking variances. From this, it may seem that the ideal value for $K$ is $\\infty$, infinite clusters! \n",
        "\n",
        "However, this introduces the problem of **overfitting**. If we have an extremely large number of clusters, this means that our $k$-means algorithm is working incredibly hard to adapt to the specific set of points we have. Unfortunately, this means that it will perform substantially worse when new data is added. To put it simply, the machine has adapted so well to the specific data points we have that it cannot flexibly adjust for new data! As a result, the ideal choice of K lies somewhere on $(1, \\infty)$. The question is, how do we find it?\n",
        "\n",
        "One very common approach for finding an optimal value for $K$ is to graph what is called an **Elbow Plot**. An Elbow Plot represents the relationship between the value of $K$ and the total within-cluster variance. This graph naturally decreases; as $K$ increases, the number of clusters is increasing and so the within-cluster variance is decreasing. However, it begins to generate diminishing marginal returns for a certain $K$, meaning that the benefits from a larger number of clusters (a decreasing total variance) begin to become smaller and smaller. It is at this point, where the diminishing marginal returns to $K$ set in, that we find our optimal $K$. Graphically, this at the point in our graph that looks like an \"elbow\", hence the name.\n",

Often, a continuous variable will take on a range of values, some of which are very small and some of which are very large. These **outliers** can skew the calculation of our mean cluster point within each cluster. For this reason, we often standardize our data points to be distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 (the standard normal distribution) to reduce the impact of these outliers on calculations of our cluster points. This allows the algorithm to create clusters that are often more precise. Luckily for us, R has the `scale` function that we can invoke to achieve this. Let's use this function to standardize the data in our _dataset2_ dataframe, then use our `kmeans` function again with our new value of $K = 4$ to create some new clusters.\n"

To see this more closely, we will work with data from COMPAS, an American risk assessment program used primarily to predict the rate of recidivism of convicted felons based on a host of personal characteristics. The data below, cleaned and prepared by authors of the following [Github repo](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis), has been retrieved from [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/), an American company specializing in investigative journalism.

We have learned that - while a powerful tool - we need to think very critically about exactly what it is doing, and whether our model makes sense.  Is it studying something fundamental, or is it just re-enforcing existing biases and patterns?\n",

Other clustering methods exist which automatically find an optimal number of clusters for us.
