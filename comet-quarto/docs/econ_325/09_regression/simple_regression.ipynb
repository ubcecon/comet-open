However, this is not the only way to measure economic income - another variable, `mrkinc` (market income), also measures income.  Let's get started with regressions by exploring the relationship between `wages` and `mrkinc` in this dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "The expectation of $X$  is what outcome we expect X to *typically* be after *a lot* of sampling. For instance, the expectation of a die throw is 3. Essentially,\n",

    "### Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where a *regression model* comes in.  A regression model specifies (the *specification*) the relationship between two variables.  For example, a linear relationship would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 W_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $M_i$ is the market income of individual $i$, and $W_i$ is their wage.  We normally (in econometrics) refer to $M_i$ as the **outcome** variable, and \n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "as the **explanatory** variable; you may have also heard the terms *dependent* and *independent*, but these aren't actually very good descriptions of what these variables are in econometrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A model like this is our description of what this relationship is - but it depends on two unknowns: $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are **parameters** of the model: they are numbers that determine the relationship (intercept and slope) between $M_i$ and $W_i$ \n",
    "* This is a linear relationship because the model we have specified is linear in the coefficients (but there are many other kinds of models).  It is also linear in the variables, but that isn't required (we will see more about this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is unlikely, if not impossible, for this relationship to completely explain everything about our data.  We need to include a term which captures everything which is _not_ described by the relationship we described in the model.  This is called the *residual* term (meaning \"leftover\").\n",
    "\n",
    "* The $\\epsilon_i$ is the residual: a component that corresponds to the part of the data which is _not_ described by the model\n",
    "* These residual terms will usually have certain assumed properties that allow us to estimate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, we can think about a regression as two parts: the part of the relationship explained by our model ($M_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 W_i$) and the part which is not explained ($\\epsilon_i$).  The process of \"fitting\" or estimating a regression model refers to the selection of values for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ such that as little needs to be explained by the residual term as possible.  We write the complete *regression equation* by combining the two parts of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 W_i + \\epsilon_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of regression analysis is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate this equation (and especially the model parameters) as accurately as possible.\n",
    "2. Learn about the relationship between $M_i$ and $W_i$ from the results of that estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to define \"accurately as possible\" and similarly there are many ways to \"estimate\" the equation.  In this course, we use *ordinary least squares* (OLS) which basically says:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(\\hat{\\beta_0},\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\arg \\min_{b_0,b_1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (M_i - b_0 - b_1 W_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (e_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, that looks complicated, but don't fear.  It is just the calculus way of writing \"choose $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ (call them $\\hat{\\beta_0},\\hat{\\beta_1}$) such that they minimize the sum of the squared residuals\".\n",
    "* This should make sense; after all, the whole point of doing a regression is to explain as much as possible using the parameters ($\\beta_0, \\beta_1$) and as little as possible using $\\epsilon_i$.\n",
    "* This has transformed our statistical problem into a calculus problem, which you (well, a computer) can solve; for example, by taking derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many ways to solve this estimation problem - most of which are built into R.  You can also solve it analytically (using some math).  But let's start with an alternative. Essentially, if you remember drawing a best fit line through points from high school, this is what a linear regression does in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Manual Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "A very *bad* way to solve this is the good-'ole eyeball method.  That's right - you look at the scatterplot, then guess some values and see how it performs.\n",

As we mentioned above, it's nearly impossible for a regression to perfectly predict the relationship between two variables, there will almost always be an associated **unobservable error** with our regression estimation. So each of the points can be modelled by the equation $Y_i = B_0 + B_1X + e_i$  This can be seen as the vertical distance between the regression line and the actual data points. You may be wondering why we can't just minimize the errors, what's the need to minimize the squared errors? You can see below that some data points are above the regression line and some are below, hence the error terms will just cancel each other out and not yield much use for us trying to find the best regression line. Therefore, we take the squares of the errors, which are depicted as the red boxes in the diagram below. Our goal is to the find the regression line that minimizes those squares of errors, hence minimize the size of those red boxes.\n",

You should see that deviation from these optimal values will only make the area of the red boxes larger."
