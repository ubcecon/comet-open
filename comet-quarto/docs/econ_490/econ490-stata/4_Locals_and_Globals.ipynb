    "1. View the characteristics of any dataset using the command `describe`.\n",
    "2. Use `help` to learn how to run commands.\n",
    "3. Understand the Stata command syntax using the command `summarize`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Recognize the difference between data set variables and Stata variables.\n",
    "2. Recognize the difference between local and global Stata variables.\n",
    "3. Use the command `local` to create temporary macros.\n",

    "\n",
    "In ECON 325 and ECON 326, you learned that \"variables\" are characteristics of a data set. For example, if we had a data set that included all of the countries in the world, we might have a variable which indicates each country's population. As another example, if we had a data set that included a sample of persons in Canada, we might have a variable which indicates each person's marital status. These are data set variables, and they can be qualitative (strings) or quantitative (numeric). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Stata, there is a separate category of variables available for use which we call \"macros\". Macros work as placeholders for values that we want to store either temporarily or permanently. Locals are macros that store data temporarily, while globals are macros that store data permanently, or at least as long as we have Stata open on our computer. We can think of Stata macros as analogous to workspace objects in Python or R. Below, you are going to learn how to use these macros in your own research."
