    "\n",
    "Difference-in-differences is a **research design** that relies on the use of multiple (at least two) time periods. The idea is that in typical cross-sectional settings (i.e. where the variables are all measured at a single point in time) it is hard to defend a `selection on observables` assumption. However, panel data allows us to control for unobserved time invariant heterogeneity. \n",

    "Consider the following example. Earnings $y_{it}$ of worker $i$ at time $t$ can be split into two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{it} = e_{it} + \\alpha_{i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha_i$ is a measure of worker quality and $e_{it}$ are the part of earnings not explained by $\\alpha_i$. This says that a bad quality worker (low $\\alpha_i$) will receive lower earnings *at any time period*. Notice that worker quality is typically unobserved and is usually part of our error term (the one that we don't want to be correlated with treatment!). In many cases, this invariant heterogeneity is the cause of endogeneity bias. In this example, it can be that workers who attend a training program also tend to be the ones that perform poorly at their job and `select` into this program. \n",

For instance, for a worker who enrolled in the training program, we observe $y_{i1}(1)$ because she indeed has $D=1$; however, we will never observe the case where she has $y_{i1}(0)$.
