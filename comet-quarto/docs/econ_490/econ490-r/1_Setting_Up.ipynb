The bare minimum for our environments is some version of Python. \n",

    "Once Anaconda has been installed, launch JupyterLab from Anaconda Navigator.

All commands given below will be typed into that terminal window in the box that follows the $.\n",

You can explore the things one can download to an environment from the  `conda-forge` channel by running, for example, `conda search r-base` or `conda search stata_kernel`. You can see that the terminal lists all the different versions of these packages that one can download from the different channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to create a new environment where we will install all these packages. In this particular case, we will create an environment based on Python 3.9.7. Let us create an environment called `stata_r_env` by writing:\n",
