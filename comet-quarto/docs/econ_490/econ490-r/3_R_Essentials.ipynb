    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be introduced to **R**. R is a programming language which is particularly well-suited for statistics, econometrics, and data science.  If you are familiar with other programming languages such as Python, this will likely be very familiar. If this is your first time working with a programming language, don't be intimidated!  Try to play around with the examples and exercises as you work through this notebook; it's easiest to learn R (or any programming language) by playing around with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "R is an object oriented programming language. This means that we can create many different things (e.g. datasets, matrix, vectors, scalars) within it and they will all be stored in the same environment and accessed the same way. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To begin, it's important to get a good grasp of the different **data types** in R and how to use them.  Whenever with work with R, we will be manipulating different kinds of information referred to as \"data\".  Data comes in many different forms, called _types_, which define how we can use it in calculations or visualizations in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "R has 6 basic data types. Data types are used to store information about a variable or object in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Character**: data in text format, like \"word\" or \"abc\"\n",
    "2. **Numeric** (real or decimal): data in real number format, like 6 or 18.8 (referred to as **Double** in R)\n",
    "3. **Integer**: data in whole number (integer) format, like 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)\n",
    "4. **Logical**: truth values, like TRUE or FALSE\n",
    "5. **Complex**: data in complex (i.e. imaginary) format, like 1+6i (where $i$ is the $\\sqrt{-1}$)\n",
    "6. **Raw**: raw digital data, which is unusual and which will not be covered in this section\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are ever wondering what kind of type an object in R has, or what its properties are, we can use the following two functions that allow us to examine the data type and elements contained within an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `typeof()`: this function returns a character string that corresponds to the data type of an object \n",
    "* `str()`: this function displays a compact internal structure of an R object \n",

    "* **Vectors**: a vector of values, like $(1,3,5,7)$\n",

A **variable** or **object** is a name assigned to a memory location in the R workspace (working memory). For now we can use the terms variable and object interchangeably. An object will always have an associated type, determined by the information assigned to it. Clear and concise object assignment is essential for **reproducible data analysis**, as mentioned in the module [Working with R Scripts](econometrics/econ490-r/2_Working_Rscripts.ipynb).\n",

We've seen this already with some of the vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames defined earlier in this notebook.\n",

This error is representative of us asking it to help by speaking German or broken English, which would certainly not work! Here are some examples of common syntax errors: using a function for which an unloaded package is needed, misspelling of a command as R is chase-sensitive, and unmatched parenthesis. How we handle syntax errors is case-by-case: we can usually solve syntax errors by reading the error message and googling it.\n",

    "* **Semantic errors**: These errors result from valid code that successfully executes but produces unintended outcomes. Again, let us suppose R speaks English. This error is representative of us asking R to hand us an apple in English, which R successfully understood, but it handed us a banana in return. This is not okay! How we handle semantic errors is also case-by-case: we can usually solve semantic errors by reading the associated error message and googling it for help/suggestions."
