    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be able to effectively use Stata do-files and generate-log files.\n",
    "2. Be able to change your directory so that Stata can find your files.\n",
    "3. Import datasets in csv and dta format. \n",
    "4. Save data files. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore your data set with commands like `describe`, `browse`,`tabulate`, `codebook` and `lookfor`.\n",
    "2. Generate dummy (or indicator) variables using the command `generate` or `tabulate`.\n",
    "3. Create new variables in Stata using `generate` and `replace`.\n",
    "4. Rename and label variables."

    "##  6.3 Generating Dummy Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Dummy variables are variables that can only take on two values: 0 and 1. It is useful to think of a dummy variable as being the answer to a question that can be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". With a dummy variable, the answer yes is coded as \"1\" and no is coded as \"0\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of question that are used to create dummy variables include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is the person female? Females are coded \"1\" and everyone else is coded \"0\".\n",
    "2. Does the person have a university degree? People with a degree are coded \"1\" and everyone else is coded \"0\".\n",
    "3. Is the person married? Married people are coded \"1\" and everyone else is coded \"0\".\n",
    "4. Is the person a millennial? People born between 1980 and 1996 are coded \"1\" and those born in other years are coded \"0\",\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have probably already figured out, dummy variables are used primarily for data that is qualitative and cannot be ranked in any way. For example, being married is qualitative and \"married\" is neither higher nor lower than \"single\".  But they are sometimes also used for variables that are qualitative and ranked, such as level of education. Further, dummy variables are sometimes used for variables that are quantitative, such as age groupings. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that dummy variables must always be used when we want to include categorical (qualitative) variables in our analysis. These are variables such as sex, gender, race, marital status, religiosity, immigration status etc. We can’t use these variables without creating a dummy variable because the results found would in no way be meaningful."
