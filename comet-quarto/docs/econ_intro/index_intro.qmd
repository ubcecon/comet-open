## Outline - Introductory Material
This section contains material to generally support COMET courses - it is not specific to any particular course, although the _Intro to Data_ module was designed for ECON 325.

* The modules are designed 1-2 hour long lab instructions
* _Intro to Jupyter_ in particular is very short and is accessible to anyone using a JupyterHub environment

You can see all of the modules in this category below, or see selected ones in sequence in the sidebar to the left.
