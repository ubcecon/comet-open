For example, if we are working with macroeconomic data from Statistics Canada such as inflation rates, GDP, and population, data for these variables may be stored in different datasets corresponding to different years. Thus, if we want to compile them we need to combine them into the same data frame.\n",

    "    * This is like looking up values in a table and then adding a column; in Excel, this is called a `VLOOKUP`. Importantly, we can only merge data that share a common column or **key** to  identify observations with particular values. For example, if we want to merge in data from a different year but for the same people (observations) as those we are currently working with, datasets will usually have an identifying number for the person that functions as our key. In this dataset, every individual is identified by their `ppsort` number, so this is the key we would use to merge in new variables. "

    "In this notebook, we have covered the basic process of working with data. You should now be familiar with how to load in data, how to define and redefine variables, how to drop missing observations, how to add in new data and drop existing data to meet your research purposes. This general scheme is critical to any research project, so it is important to keep in mind as you progress throughout your undergraduate economics courses and beyond."
