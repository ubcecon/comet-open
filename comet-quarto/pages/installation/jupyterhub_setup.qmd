The easiest way to load and use these notebooks is via a JupyterHub. This cloud-based server hosts all of the computational resources needed to run the notebooks. Better still, since it runs in the cloud you donâ€™t need to install anything on your computer, and the performance is not affected by your system resources.

-   To launch in a cloud environment, select launch COMET from the top navigation bar, and then choose your hub. For UBC students, we recommend **JupyterOpen**, which is a UBC-supported hub which we maintain, and has all of the necessary packages pre-installed and robust space and processor support. *Note that you must have a Campus-Wide Login (CWL) in order to access these resources.*

-   If JupyterOpen is not working, you can also use PIMS Syzygy (Siz-za-gee). There is a UBC-specific version of this server, and several others that use a Google account or other authentication method.

-   Finally, if you are part of the Google ecosystem, you can launch them on Google Collab which has a slightly different appearance but it otherwise the same.

::: callout-warning
Syzygy and Google Collab are not officially supported UBC software, and may not be privacy-compliant. You should take responsibility for your own use of these resources if you choose to use them. If Google already has all your data, too bad!

Once you are on the server, use the file navigation on the left to find the notebook you are interested in: we recommend starting with intro_jupyter which is under docs/econ_intro. Open the folder and click on the .ipynb file to start the notebook.
