The modules in this unit are **Getting Started** level.  They are intended for people who are totally new to  tools like Jupyter and `R`.  All of our other materials rely on these ones, so you could plan to review it carefully.

* If you are looking to filter by a specific course, select the course number in the list of categories from the browse all section.
* If you're looking for the first notebook, check out [Introduction to Jupyter](../../docs/Getting_started/getting_started_intro_to_jupyter/getting_started_intro_to_jupyter.qmd).

You can also see our [Quickstart Guide](../quickstart.qmd) if you need help getting set-up.
