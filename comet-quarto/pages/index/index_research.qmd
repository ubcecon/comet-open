This section contains material to support UBC's [ECON 490 Seminar in Applied Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/undergraduate/courses/econ-490-course-information/).  This course is a our senior research class, which focuses on conducting an original research project - including applied econometrics analysis, writing, and presentation.

There are **three versions** of these notebooks: two for STATA, and one for R.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## STATA Notebooks

These notebooks using the STATA programming language, and are launch in Jupyter using the `stata_kernel`.  You will only be able to run these locally, not via most commercial JupyterHubs.

## R Notebooks

These notebooks are written for the `R` programming language and are launched in Jupyter using the `IRKernel`.

::::::{#r}

## pystata Notebooks

`pystata` is a Python package that runs STATA code.  So, these are Python notebooks, but they run STATA code.  You will only be able to run these locally, not via most commercial JupyterHubs.
