The modules in this unit are **Intermediate** level.  They are intended for people who have mastered the basics and are ready to use and `R` for applied econometric modeling.

* If you are looking to filter by a specific course, select the course number in the list of categories on the right.
* If you're looking for projects, check out our [projects page](index_research.qmd) pages for some example and guides.

You should make sure you're familiar with the basics of R and using data before starting these notebooks.  There are also some notebooks that focus on geographic and geospatial computation.  This section contains material originally built to support UBCâ€™s **GEOG 374 (Statistics in Geography)**.  This course covers statistical techniques for geography. For economics students, these are a valuable supplement to our intermediate econometrics courses.
