The modules in this unit are **Beginner** level.  They are intended for people who are starting to learn how to use tools like Jupyter and `R` for applied econometrics.  Many courses share this material, and you should try working through the notebooks in order.

* If you are looking to filter by a specific course, select the course number in the list of categories on the right.
* If you're looking for the basics, check out our [getting started](index_getting_started.qmd) pages for an introduction.

You should make sure you're familiar with the basics of R and using data before starting these notebooks.
