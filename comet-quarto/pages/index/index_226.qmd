This section contains material to support UBC's ECON 226 Making Sense of Economic Data.  This course is an introductory course intended to give students a general introduction to probability and statistics in an econometric setting.

* These modules in particular are designed to be used in 1 or 2 one-hour long lab environments, with TA or Instructor supervision
* They can also be used for self-study, with some additional effort

These materials are a review of basic probability, which contains overlap with AP and IB Statistics from high school.
