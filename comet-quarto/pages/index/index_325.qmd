This section contains material to support UBC's [ECON 325 Introduction to Empirical Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/courses/?subject=econ).  This course is a first course in econometrics, and is designed to give students a general introduction to probability and statistics, in the econometric setting.

* These modules in particular are designed to be used in 1 or 2 one-hour long lab environments, with TA or Instructor supervision
* They can also be used for self-study, with some additional effort

These materials do not (currently) include a review of basic probability, which is slated for future development due to the overlap this has with AP and IB Statistics from high school.
