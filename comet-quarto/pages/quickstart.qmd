Want to get started using COMET as soon as possible?  It's as easy as 1-2-3!

1.  Choose a **JupyterHub** to launch the COMET service on.  We currently support three options:
    a.  *JupyterOpen* for students and faculty at UBC
    b.  *[PIMS'](https://www.pims.math.ca/) Syzygy* for non-UBC-affiliates and others
    c.  *Google Collab* for people with a Google account

::: {.callout-tip}
We recommend **JupyterOpen** for UBC students, since it has all of the necessary packages pre-loaded for you.

* Other hubs may need to [install packages](installation/installing_locally.qmd) in order for some notebooks to work properly.

2.  Click on the **"Launch COMET"** button on the top-right of the navigation bar on this page:

And select your JupyterHub

3.  Log in using your hub credentials, wait for the project to load, then open a notebook under the `comet-project` directory!

You're all ready to go!  You can see more details in our [using COMET guide.](installation/installing_locally.qmd)

## Using Locally

Want to run COMET on your own computer?  Don't have a reliable internet connection?  Want to be a power user or have a favourite IDE?  You don't have to rely on a JupyterHub to use COMET.

1.  [Install Jupyter or RStudio locally](installation/rstudio_setup.qmd) on your own computer, including R and any other packages necessary.
2.  Select "Launch Locally" from the "Launch COMET" menu and download the repository files.
3.  Unzip the files and open them in your local IDE.  

You're all ready to go!
