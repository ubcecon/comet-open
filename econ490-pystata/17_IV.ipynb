    "Consider a case where we want to know the effect of education on earnings. We may want to estimate a model like the following\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta X_i + \\epsilon_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $Y_i$ is earnings of individual $i$ and $X_i$ is years of education of individual $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible issue comes from omitted variable bias: it is possible that the decision to attend school is influenced by other individual characteristics that are also correlated with earnings. For example, think of individuals with high innate ability. They may want to enroll in school for longer and obtain higher-level degrees. Moreover, their employers may compensate them for their high ability, regardless of their years of schooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instrumental variables can help us when there are hidden factors affecting both the treatment (in our case, years of education) and the outcome (in our case, earnings). The instrumental variables approach relies on finding something affecting the treatment and affecting the outcome solely through the treatment. In short, the instrument should satisfy two assumptions:\n",
    "1. *relevance*: the instrument should be correlated with the explanatory variable; in our case, it should be correlated with the years of education $X_i$;\n",
    "2. *exclusion restriction*: the instrument should be correlated with the dependent variable only through the explanatory variable; in our case, it should be correlated with $Y_i$ only through its correlation with $X_i$.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. $\\gamma \\neq 0$;\n",
    "2. $Z_i$ is uncorrelated with $u_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, using an Instrumental Variable analysis often implies using a Two-Stages Least Square (2SLS) estimator. The two steps of the 2SLS are:\n",
    "1. Estimate the First Stage Equation by OLS and obtain the predicted value of $X_i$. In this way, we have effectively split $X_i$ into\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Plug $\\hat{X_i}$ instead of $X_i$ into the Structural Equation and estimate via OLS. We are then using the \"exogenous\" part of $X_i$ to capture $\\beta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution**: We can run 2SLS following the steps above, but when we want to do inference we need to be sure we're using the true residuals in the Structural equation $\\hat{u}_i$. The built-in Stata command `ivregress` or `ivreg2` automatically give us the right residuals.\n",
