        "is now a dummy for being *both* a female and having a university degree.\n",
        "You can see why this is true:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \n",
        "D_i \\times F_i = 1 \\iff D_i = 1 \\text{ and } F_i = 1\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This is why these terms are so important for understanding regressions:\n",
        "they provide us with a simple way to describe and study how\n",
        "*combinations* of our explanatory variables impact our model. These\n",

        "\n",

        "1.  The main reason is that R (and you, the analyst) lose track of the\n",
        "    relationship between the created interaction variable and the\n",
        "    underlying variables. This means that you can’t use other tools to\n",
        "    analyze this relationship (there are many packages such as `margins`\n",
        "    which allow you to investigate complex interactions) which is a big\n",
        "    loss. You also can’t perform post-regression analysis on the\n",
        "    underlying variables in a simple way anymore.\n",
        "2.  The second reason is that it’s easy to make mistakes. You might\n",
        "    define the interaction incorrectly (possible!). However, it’s more\n",
        "    of an issue if later on you change the underlying variables and then\n",
        "    forget to re-compute the interactions. It also makes your code\n",
        "    harder to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bottom line: don’t do it. Interactions in R are easy to create: you\n",

        "-   The `:` operator creates the interaction(s) of the two variables in\n",
