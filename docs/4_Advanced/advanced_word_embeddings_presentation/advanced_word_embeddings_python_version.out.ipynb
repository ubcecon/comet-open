        "1.  First, the input word gets compressed into a dense vector, as seen\n",
        "    in the simplified diagram, “Creating a Word Embedding,” above.\n",

        "    Keywords that appear within similar contexts will have similar\n",
        "    vector representations in between steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine that each word in a novel has its meaning determined by the ones\n",
