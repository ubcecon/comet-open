        "\n",
        "1.  Load data and packages.\n",
        "2.  Create variables and objects.\n",

        "## Learning Outcomes\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Identify best practices for data visualization.\n",

        "    data: scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and histograms.\n",

        "If you are familiar with Stata, you will notice that graphs in R are\n",
        "completely different. The most important and widely used package for\n",
        "data visualization in R is `ggplot2`. This package operates under the\n",
        "premise that every graph can be decomposed into the following layers:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Data: the very base of every graph, where the information comes\n",
        "    from.\n",
        "-   Mapping: informs graphics which variables are going to be part of\n",
        "    some graphical property (e.g. column 3 of the data is going to be\n",
        "    the dependent variable and y-axis of some graph).\n",
        "-   Statistics: transforms the input variables to be displayed\n",
        "    (e.g. graphs the means of some particular columns, counts the number\n",
        "    of observations in some category).\n",
        "-   Scales: indicates the relationship between variables and properties\n",
        "    (e.g. we want to associate different colours with different values\n",
        "    of a region variable).\n",
        "-   Geometries: a key layer of the graph structure. The geometry\n",
        "    indicates the general aesthetic of the graph (e.g. a line, a\n",
        "    polygon, etc).\n",
        "-   Facets: this can be used to split data into different sub-plots.\n",
        "-   Coordinates: dictates the positioning of variables. It thinks of the\n",
        "    world as an X and Y axis by default, but more generally there can be\n",
        "    more complicated structures (e.g. cartography!).\n",
        "-   Theme: deals with other graphic information that is not related to\n",
        "    the previous parts (e.g. background colour of our graph).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, we will look at how to construct a standard graph.\n",
