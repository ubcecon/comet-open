        "Tables](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en) which measure\n",
        "income, input, output, and productivity, covering 183 countries between\n",
        "1950 and 2019. Before beginning this module, download this data in the\n",

        "\n",
        "## 14.1 What is Panel Data?\n",
        "\n",
        "In economics, we typically have data consisting of many units observed\n",
        "at a particular point in time. This is called cross-sectional data.\n",
        "There may be several different versions of the data set that are\n",
        "collected over time (monthly, annually, etc.), but each version includes\n",
        "an entirely different set of individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let’s consider a Canadian cross-sectional data set:\n",
        "*General Social Survey Cycle 31: Family, 2017*. In this data set, the\n",
        "first observation is a 55 year old married woman who lives in Alberta\n",
        "with two children. When the *General Social Survey Cycle 25: Family,\n",
        "2011* was collected six years earlier, there were probably similar women\n",
        "surveyed, but it is extremely unlikely that this exact same woman was\n",
        "included in that data set as well. Even if she was included, we would\n",
        "have no way to match her data over the two years of the survey.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cross-sectional data allows us to explore variation between individuals\n",
        "at one point in time but does not allow us to explore variation over\n",
        "time for those same individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Time-series data sets contain observations over several years for only\n",
        "one unit, such as country, state, province, etc. For example, measures\n",
        "of income, output, unemployment, and fertility for Canada from 1960 to\n",
        "2020 would be considered time-series data. Time-series data allows us to\n",
        "explore variation over time for one individual unit (e.g. Canada), but\n",
        "does not allow us to explore variation between individual units\n",
        "(i.e. multiple countries) at any one point in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Panel data allows us to observe the same unit across multiple time\n",
        "periods. For example, the [Penn World\n",
        "Tables](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en) is a panel\n",
        "data set that measures income, output, input, and productivity, covering\n",
        "183 countries from 1950 to the near present. There are also microdata\n",
        "panel data sets that follow the same people over time. One example is\n",
        "the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY),\n",
        "which followed the same children from 1994 to 2010, surveying them every\n",
        "two years as they progressed from childhood to adulthood.\n",
        "\n",
        "Panel data sets allow us to answer questions that we cannot answer with\n",
        "time-series and cross-sectional data. They allow us to simultaneously\n",
        "explore variation over time for individual countries (for example) and\n",
        "variation between individuals at one point in time. This approach is\n",
        "extremely productive for two reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Panel data sets are large, much larger than if we were to use data\n",
        "    collected at one point in time.\n",
        "2.  Panel data regressions control for variables that do not change over\n",
        "    time and are difficult to measure, such as geography and culture.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this sense, panel data sets allow us to answer empirical questions\n",
        "that cannot be answered with other types of data such as cross-sectional\n",
        "or time-series data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we move forward exploring panel data sets in this module, we\n",
        "should understand the two main types of panel data:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A **Balanced Panel** is a panel data set in which we observe *all*\n",
        "    units over *all* included time periods. Suppose we have a data set\n",
        "    following the school outcomes of a select group of $N$ children over\n",
        "    $T$ years. This is common in studies which investigate the effects\n",
        "    of early childhood interventions on relevant outcomes over time. If\n",
        "    the panel data set is balanced, we will see $T$ observations for\n",
        "    each child corresponding to the $T$ years they have been tracked. As\n",
        "    a result, our data set in total will have $n = N*T$ observations.\n",
        "-   An **Unbalanced Panel** is a panel data set in which we do *not*\n",
        "    observe all units over all included time periods. Suppose in our\n",
        "    data set tracking select children’s education outcomes over time,\n",
        "    and that some children drop out of the study. This panel data set\n",
        "    would be an unbalanced panel because it would necessarily have\n",
        "    $n < N*T$ observations, since the children who dropped out would not\n",
        "    have observations for the years they were no longer in the study.\n",
        "\n",
        "We learned the techniques to create a balanced panel in [Module\n",
        "6](https://comet.arts.ubc.ca/docs/Research/econ490-r/06_Within_Group.html).\n",
        "Essentially, all that is needed is to create a new data set that\n",
        "includes only the years for which there are no missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 14.2 Preparing Our Data for Panel Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step in any panel data analysis is to identify which variable\n",
        "is the panel variable and which variable is the time variable. The panel\n",
        "variable is the identifier of the units that are observed over time. The\n",
        "second step is indicating that information to R.\n",
