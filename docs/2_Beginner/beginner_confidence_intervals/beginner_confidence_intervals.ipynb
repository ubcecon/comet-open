        "under which our estimated population parameter **must** fall*.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we repeated our sampling procedure many times and constructed a\n",
        "confidence interval each time, we would expect about 95% of these\n",
        "confidence intervals to contain our true parameter. **Note that this\n",
        "does not imply that the confidence interval we calculated contains the\n",
        "true parameter**. Since about 5% of our confidence intervals will not\n",
        "contain the true parameter, nothing prevents the confidence interval we\n",

        "Main takeaway is that the confidence interval is an *estimator* and not\n",

        "### Misconception 2:\n",
        "\n",
        "*If we have a confidence level of 95%, 95% of our population data must\n",
        "lie within the calculated confidence interval*.\n",

        "for the population and calculate percentiles.\n",

        "clustered far to the right of our mean), our calculated 95% confidence\n",

        "one interval from a sample of $n = 100$ has a 95% chance of containing\n",
