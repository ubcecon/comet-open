        "a property of the data itself. It is only a representation; there can be\n",
        "other kinds of representations. For example, a panel data set might have\n",
        "each row as a unit (e.g. country) and each column might represent a\n",
        "variable in a year (e.g. unemployment in 2016, unemployment in 2017,\n",
        "etc.). Often, when we work with real-world data we have to reshape it in\n",
        "order for it to be usable - but in this course, we won’t worry about\n",
        "that just yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data can be stored in many different file formats (which encode how\n",
