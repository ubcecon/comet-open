This section contains material to support UBC's [ECON 326 Methods of Empirical Research in Economics](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=ECON&course=326).  This course is a second course in econometrics, and focuses on econometric modeling - specifically using regression-based models

* These modules in particular are designed to be used in 1 or 2 one-hour long lab environments, with TA or Instructor supervision, or in a flipped classroom setting (i.e. as a lecture)
* They include a number of **exercises** which are intended to be formative (i.e. not graded) in nature, and can be addressed during the lab
* They can also be used for self-study, with some additional effort
