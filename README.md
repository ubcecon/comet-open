# TLEF Project: Developing interactive learning modules for hands-on-econometrics skills

_(We need a cooler title)_

Welcome to the repository for our large TLEF project.  This site stores our materials for developing Jupyter-based notebooks to support teaching introductory and intermediate econometrics courses.  This project is funded by the University of British Columbia.  The motivating "pitch" is as follows:

> Currently, all economics students take several courses in the application of economic theory and models to data using statistical methods (econometrics).  Many students struggle to engage with this material, particularly when it comes to practical applications and hands-on experience – putting them at a disadvantage following graduation or in more advanced courses.
>This project will address this challenge by creating a collection of hands-on modules designed around best practices for teaching statistics.  These modules, focused on economic questions, models, and data, will use interactive notebook-based technologies (Jupyter) to synthesize analysis, discussion, and conceptualization into a single learning experience – appropriate for either laboratory or flipped classroom instruction.
>By adapting proven pedagogical strategies and integrating this material throughout the economics curriculum, students will better master these valuable skills.  This project will also improve accessibility, by lowering costs and hardware requirements, and will produce a library of open educational resources for broader instructional needs.

## Repository Commit Guidelines

It is very important that you follow these guidelines when committing work to the repository, in order to keep things well-organized.

There are two special branches: `main` and `pages`.

* `main` is the current "completed" set of modules or units, ready for deployment.
* `pages` is a special branch which is reserved for website deployment.

1.  Do **not** commit to either `pages` or `main` without specific guidance to do so.  Always change these branches through a merge request instead.
2.  Keep each _new_ module or unit on its own branch: when you start working on a new module, create a new branch of _main_ to store your work with a descriptive name.  Don't use an existing branch for a new modules.
3.  When you are finished a module, create a merge request for it back to main, and delete the old branch.

Ensure that you keep your commits clean and tidy:

* Use a descriptive commit title and description
* Make sure you have removed temporary files and other materials

Any commits or merge requests that do not meet these guidelines will be rejected and will need to be re-done.
