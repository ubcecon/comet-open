# Outline - Intro Modules
This section contains material to generally support COMET courses - it is not specific to any particular course, although the _Intro to Data_ module was designed for ECON 325.
* The modules are designed 1-2 hour long lab instructions
* _Intro to Jupyter_ in particular is very short and is accessible to anyone using a JupyterHub environment
