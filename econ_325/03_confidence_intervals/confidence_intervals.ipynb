    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have developed a strong grasp of core concepts in statistics. We've learned about measures of central tendency and variation, as well as how these measures relate to distributions. We have also learned about random sampling and how sampling distributions can shed light on the parameters of a population distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can we apply this knowledge to real empirical work? While another notebook that covers hypothesis testing will provide a deeper answer to this question, this current notebook provides a starting point. In this notebook, we will learn about a key concept which relates to how we report our results empirically when sampling from a population. This is the idea of a **confidence interval**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Intervals and Point Estimates\n",
    "A **confidence interval** is an estimate that gives us a range of values within which we expect a population parameter to fall. Put another way, it provides a range within which we can have a certain degree of _confidence_ that a desired parameter, such as a population mean, lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast to a **point estimate**.  A point estimate is a specific estimated value of another object, like a population parameter.  For instance, the sample mean and sample standard deviation are point estimates of the population mean and the population standard deviation (respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make this concrete with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we want to know the mean GPA of undergraduate students at universities across Canada. Finding this exact mean (the population mean) would require us to collect the GPA of every single undergraduate student in the country without error: a nearly impossible task. As a result, and as we have already seen, we collect a sample of students and find the mean of their GPAs (the sample mean). This allows us to make inferences about the desired, yet unobtainable, population mean. The sample mean we find is called our point estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we already learned, this sample mean will be different every time we draw a different random sample of undergraduate students. Suppose one random sample we draw just so happens to include many high-achieving students, while another does not. The first sample will give us a very high point estimate for the population mean, while the second sample will give us a point estimate much lower. \n",
    "\n",
    "So our question becomes: how can we report an estimate for the population mean GPA if we  draw a different mean GPA for every possible sample? This is where **confidence intervals** become useful.  They allow us to combine information about central tendency and dispersion into a single object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Levels\n",
    "As we will see, every time we draw a sample and get a new point estimate, we can compute a confidence interval to describe the precision of this estimate. To calculate this confidence interval, we always must choose a **confidence level**. This is a percentage which represents the long-run percentage of confidence intervals within which we would expect to actually find our desired population parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "We choose a higher confidence level when we want to have more certainty in our confidence interval serving as a good estimate for the population parameter of interest. The most commonly chosen confidence level is 95%, but other values are also common.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In our GPA example, this means that if we drew random samples of undergraduate students 1000 different times and got 1000 sample mean point estimates and corresponding confidence intervals, we would expect 950 of these confidence intervals to contain the actual average GPA of all Canadian undergraduates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we cannot conclusively *find* the desired population mean to prove this; however, choosing a high confidence level gives us more certainty that any one of our hypothetical confidence intervals (including the one we actually calculate from our specific sampling) includes our unknowable parameter of interest. When we choose a confidence level of 95% and calculate a confidence interval around our sample mean point estimate, we say that we are **95% confident** that the true mean GPA of all Canadian undergraduates lies in this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now see how we actually calculate a confidence interval for a given point estimate and confidence level."

While this general formula and format for the confidence interval always holds, calculating the margin of error varies depending on what sample statistic we are looking at and what we know about our population. Let's look at few important special cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Intervals for the Sample Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to construct a confidence interval for a sample mean we've found (e.g. the mean GPA of a sample of Canadian undergraduates), we must first reflect on how we gathered our data and what its sampling distribution looks like. This is because we must meet the following three conditions in order to construct a valid confidence interval for a sample mean in the first place:\n",
    " > 1. We must have a random sample (typically found through simple random sampling)\n",
    "2. The sampling distribution of the sample means is approximately normal, which can be met through one of the following ways: <br>\n",
    " a. our original population is normally distributed <br>\n",
    " b. our sample size is > 120 (invokes the Central Limit Theorem)\n",
    "3. Our sample observations must be independent, for instance: <br>\n",
    " a. we sample with replacement (when we record an observation, we put it back in the population with the possibility of drawing it again) <br>\n",
    " b. our sample size is < 10% of the population size\n",
    " \n",
    "If each of conditions 1-3 are met, we are able to construct a valid confidence interval around our sample mean point estimate.  There are two different cases for this construction, but they're pretty similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 1: We Know the Population Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "In rare instances, we may know the variance (and thus standard deviation) of our original population of interest. In this case, we are able to consult our trustworthy $z$-statistic when calculating the margin of error in our confidence interval. We use the following formula to calculate the confidence interval for a sample mean when our population standard deviation is known:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar x \\pm z_{\\alpha / 2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt n}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar x$ is the sample mean, $z$ is the critical value (from the standard normal distribution) for a chosen confidence level $1-\\alpha$, $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this case is extremely rare. After all, it requires us to know the standard deviation but not the mean of a population! Typically we either have very good information on a population (and thus know both its mean and standard deviation) or we don't (and thus don't know either its mean or standard deviation). Nonetheless, it is good to keep this case in mind since it occasionally comes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 2: We Don't Know the Population Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Much more frequently, we won't know the population standard deviation. In this case, we must instead invoke the $t$-distribution when calculating the margin of error for our confidence intervals. We also use the sample standard deviation in place of the population standard deviation, since we do know this statistic. The calculation procedure otherwise follows exactly as before in Case 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar x \\pm t_{\\alpha / 2} \\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt n}\n",
    "$$ <br>\n",
    "where $\\bar x$ is the sample mean, $t$ is the critical value (from the  $t$-distribution) for a chosen confidence level $1-\\alpha$, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size."

    "## Confidence Intervals for the Sample Proportion\n",

    "While we've looked at the example of mean GPA throughout this notebook, we can also calculate confidence intervals for sample proportions as well. Imagine we have just two political parties (A and B), compulsory voting, and we want to know the proportion of the population that voted for party A. Of course, this would be quite costly and time-consuming to calculate, so we instead collect a sample and corresponding sample proportion. This sample proportion becomes our point estimate around which we construct a confidence interval to estimate the population proportion with a certain degree of confidence. Before we begin constructing this interval, we must make sure that our sampling process again satisfies three conditions; this time, however, the second of these three conditions will be different:\n",

If we draw a larger sample, then for any confidence level we can expect to estimate our desired population parameter more precisely. This is indicated by a narrower confidence interval. The same logic applies when we decrease our sample size $n$. Both our margin of error and confidence interval will increase, indicative of the fact that our sample is smaller and we therefore have less precision in estimating our population parameter of interest.

To capture this paramater more frequently for a given sample size, the width of our confidence interval (the range of possibilities for capturing the true parameter) must naturally increase.

    "Hopefully the error in this way of thinking is quite clear now. If we repeated our sampling procedure many times and constructed a confidence interval each time, we would expect about 95% of these confidence intervals to contain our true parameter. However, this is not 100%. Theoretically, about 5% of our confidence intervals will not contain the true paramater. There is no stopping the actual confidence interval we calculate from being one of those 5%. Due to this, we cannot say with absolute certainty that our true paramater lies within the interval that we calculate. It is a common mistake to assume that a confidence interval is an official range within which the true paramater need fall. It can fall anywhere, it is just quite likely (very likely if our confidence level is high enough) that it falls within the interval calculated, hence we can have some trust in it as an estimator. This is why the confidence interval is an *estimator* and not a concrete range of possible values for our population paramater. If we had 100% certainty the true paramater fell within our calculated interval, it would not be much of an estimator but instead just a complete spectrum of the possible values the paramater could take on."

It says nothing about the spread of our actual data. To find the range within which 95% of our data lie, we must consult a histogram for the population. It could easily be the case that our data is quite bimodally distributed (around half of our data is clustered far to the left of our mean, and the other half is clustered far to the right of our mean). In this case, our calculated 95% confidence interval will likely contain very little (much less than 95%) of the data."

    "This one might feel quite counterintuitive. After all, we already know from the previous section that a confidence interval generated from the sample $n = 500$ will be smaller than one generated from $n = 100$. However, think about the nuance of this statement. A confidence level by definition is the percentage of calculated intervals we expect to contain the true paramater of interest if we calculated these intervals over and over. In this situation, any one interval from a sample of $n = 100$ has a 95% of containing the true paramater, just as any one interval from a sample of $n = 500$ has a 95% of containing the true paramater. Each interval (the wider one from $n = 100$ and narrower one from $n= 500$) has a chance of containing the true parameter in relation to all other calculated intervals for that same sample size. The probability of a given interval containing the true paramater is in no way influenced by or varies with the sample size. This probability only changes when we change our confidence level."
