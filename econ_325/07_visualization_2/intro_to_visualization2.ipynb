    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the notebook \"Introduction to Visualization 1,\" we learned about scatter, line and bar charts, as well as histograms. This notebook expands on the concepts introduced in Introduction to Data Visualization 1 and offers a more in depth and granular toolkit for creating visualizations. Because we're already familiar with the theoretical concepts of `ggplot2`, this notebook serves as more of a resource guide with practical case study examples than as a learning module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of layers is fundamental to `ggplot2` - in this notebook we'll explore a few more layering customizations that can help make our visualizations look extra polished. We'll also see how our new tools perform in a few case study examples."

    "In notebook 1 we introduced the `labs()` function which allows us to specify the aesthetic outputs of different labels on our chart, such as the x and y axis titles, the legend title and main graph title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few best practices to keep in mind when crafting and adding labels to charts (pulled from [FusionCharts 2022](https://www.fusioncharts.com/resources/charting-best-practices/5-tips-for-writing-chart-captions)):\n",
    "* Graph title: should summarize the graph in short, understandable language that is as objective as possible - avoid using unnecessary words such as \"the\", \"a\", or \"an\", as well as adjectives like \"amazing\" or \"poor\" which can manipulate your reader's perception of the graphic.\n",
    "  * Example: _\"Online Grocery Order Growth 2018 vs 2020\"_ (a better title)  vs _\"The Significant Growth in Online Grocery Orders in the years 2018 and 2020\"_ (a worse title)\n",
    "* Graph subtitle: should be used to add helpful supplemental information that will help your audience understand the graph.\n",
    "  * Example: Units of measurement, time frames (if this is secondary information)\n",
    "* Axis Labels: units of measurement should always be made known! If the data is labeled inside the visualization, sometimes axis labels are not necessary - we should always ask ourselves: what does our audience need to know?\n",
