    "In this worksheet we’ll be learning about what **JupyterNotebooks** are and how they work. If you’re reading this, you’re already connected to a Notebook and are one step closer to becoming a Jupyter expert! Notebooks are easily accessed through **JupyterHub**, which is a web-based interactive integrated development environment (IDE) typically maintained by an organization or institution. These hubs often have different software and tools for collaboration preconfigured for students like you to use. Both JuptyerHub and JupyterNotebooks stem from **Jupyter**, which is a connected system of open-source tools designed to support interactive, web-based computing (<https://jupyter.org/>)."

    "## Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few key terms that define and contextualize components of the technical environment which Jupyter operates in. As you work through this notebook, try to identify the various (largely invisible) processes and infrastructures that enable you to read the contents of this notebook, run code cells and write text in the notebook, among other things. \n",
    "\n",
    "* An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a type of software application that can be used to work on coding tasks. JupyterHub is an IDE that works really well for collaborative econometric analyses because it contains various features that allow users to write, upload, co-develop and give feedback on files.\n",
    "* **Open source** is a copyright term which refers to a source code that is made freely available for modification and sharing. Jupyter and JupyterNotebooks are an example of an open source project because anyone can access the code and documentation used to make them.\n",
    "* **Cloud based** describes any computing services or resources that rely on the internet to function. If you are reading this notebook in a browser, for example, your device has used the internet protocol to request access to this notebook from the server that stores this notebook (the server said yes!)  \n",
    "* The **Client-server relationship** is the underlying relationship that allows the internet to exist as we know it. **Client** refers to the computer asking for information on the internet and **server** refers to the computer that responds to requests. \n",
    "* A **Kernel** is an execution environment which connects Notebooks with programming languages in order to allow code (written in R or Python, for example) to be executed in the Notebook. Clients (you) can send instructions to a kernel to perform operations on data.\n",
    "    > For example, when the operation $1+1$ is typed into a JupyterNotebook, the web browser (that you are viewing the notebook in) sends a request to the kernel (for this notebook, the _R_ kernel is being used) which computes the request and sends the answer back to your Notebook, producing the result: $2$\n",
    "\n",
    "One final term to consider as you begin using Notebooks for econometrics is **Reproducibility**. Reproducibility is a core priority in data science. It means ensuring the creation of analyses that can reliably re-produce the same results when analyzing the same data at a later time. Notebooks allow us to write executable code, attach multimedia and leave meaningful text annotations and discussion throughout our analysis, which contributes to a reproducible and transparent data workflow."
