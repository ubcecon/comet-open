1ivboeh,me4t1nd,cgnVirtue,"Hey man, I feel for you. I’m really sorry that that happened to you. That shit sucks. I might be just a stranger on the internet, but I’m here for you. 

I have a basic rundown on advice I wish someone told me when I experienced my worst breakup. 

First, that shit sucks. Let it. It’s always going to. That shit mattered to you, and that’s okay. It’s not gonna be easy. It’ll probably be pretty difficult all things considered. You will remember. You will grieve. I wouldn’t avoid it. Let it happen when it does, and enjoy yourself when it doesn’t. Those things are pretty much unavoidable, and the more you try to avoid them, it’ll suck. 

But there are things that you can control. Like how you push through. I don’t really like the term “moving on”, because “pushing through” to me sounds more like what it feels like. Like moving through tar but instead it’s grief. But yeah, how you push through it and keep living despite the fact that it sucks. Even if you do literally nothing but eat once on a Saturday, you still pushed through. And that’s good enough. Because it won’t be like this forever. And the grief won’t always win. 

Alright I don’t wanna turn this into a lecture of feels lmao. And I don’t know if this’ll actually mean anything to you or help at all. But if it hits home or helps at all, my DMs are open. I hope it helps you. But no matter what, you’re not alone.",6,1740212663.0

I’m also in first year and struggled immensely during the university application process simply because I wanted to do so many things and none of my passions particularly stood out to me. I always wanted to be a doctor, so I applied for biology, health sciences etc but later realized that path isn’t for me; it’s too long and demanding. So I’m in sciences now looking to major in stats and cs or data science. 

A few months ago I had an epitome where I found myself so deeply immersed in problem solving and actually found maths and physics to be kind of fun. Then I wanted to switch to engineering… almost submitted an application, but ended up not. 

I think the greatest advice I got was to do something that you enjoy( doesn’t have to be what you enjoy most) but it is what you are most good at AND it is a degree that will provide you the lifestyle you envision. What’s your strength? Is it sciences, chemistry, bio? Then maybe consider food nutrition and health. Is it writing, reading, advocacy and some logic? Choose IR. Think about your end goal with either degrees, is it to become a dietician, law school or anything else?

Close to graduation, I realized jobs in the IR sector were few and far between (especially for folks with Bachelor's degrees only), and wasn't happy with anything I could get. (Not saying IR sucks, but I couldn't find anything suitable with my dream employer at Global Affairs. NGOs were also not my cup of tea.)

1iv5e0b,me3rrrb,OnionTraining1688,"Honest opinion from a Sauder Masters grad:
1. UBC and RHL skimp out on scholarships especially if you have no international (read American/Canadian) work experience as an international student. The 2-3 people who did get scholarships before the program started turned out to be the least disciplined in our batch, bunking lectures at will, propagating gossip and groupism, and souring well-meaning students’ experience. So do NOT depend on Sauder, the most you can do is explain your situation via email but do not expect anything.
2. During times of an economic slump like the one right now, business programs do not retain as bang-for-buck value as tech jobs or skilled trades. You’re walking into major uncertainty, with no guarantee when you’ll be employed after graduation.

Take it as a blessing in disguise and aim for UofT, Queens, Ivey, or an Ivy League school in a year or two when things are stable for you.",1,1740194894.0

1iv5e0b,me51k8s,Forest-Elf1806,"As an international student in Sauder, I think you should try at least take the first two years in a college and then apply to transfer to UBC Sauder for third year. Many students do that, because college cost three times less than UBC’s fee. You should research that path just in case you’re interested. Of course, it would be a lot better to be in Sauder since first year, since they will teach you how to improve your resume and cover letter, and there’s a tons of clubs to get involved and network.
