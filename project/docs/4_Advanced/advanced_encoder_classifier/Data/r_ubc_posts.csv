1ivohu2,I want a girlfriend,Local_Nose_4945,"# That adorable TA love story made me both happy and lonely?? Where is my future wifeüò≠

I just want a girlfriend who actually has hobbies‚Äîlike¬†*real*¬†hobbies, not just ""going out to eat"" or scrolling TikTok for six hours. Someone who takes care of herself, doesn‚Äôt stay up until 5 AM every night for no reason, remembers to eat and drink water without needing constant reminders, isn‚Äôt just going along with whatever everyone else is doing but actually thinks for herself.

Values my opinions, is willing to grow and grow together, and sees value in having a family one day. Also, she showers (low bar, I know, but we‚Äôve all seen things), treats service workers with basic decency, is kind to her friends and family, keeps herself active but isn‚Äôt obsessed with gym selfies, cleans her room AND her bathroom (and doesn‚Äôt leave enough hair in the shower to clog a drain every week), doesn‚Äôt keep Tinder for ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù months into our relationship, doesn‚Äôt make me feel unimportant, respects herself, communicates when she‚Äôs upset instead of making me guess, doesn‚Äôt have a scary amount of Shein hauls, reads at least¬†*one*¬†book occasionally, doesn‚Äôt have to be a comedian but at least has a normal sense of humor, has actual life goals, isn‚Äôt just looking for one thing, doesn‚Äôt treat me like a trophy, has a social life but isn‚Äôt out clubbing 24/7, doesn‚Äôt try to make me constantly one-up her friends' boyfriends, texts like a normal human being, can cook at least something that is edible, enjoys active activities, likes being in nature, is financially responsible, doesn‚Äôt make fun of my insecurities, supports my goals and hobbies, doesn‚Äôt smoke or vape.

Anyway, just venting because that post about the girl falling for her TA was way too cute and now I‚Äôm in my feelings.",16,1,1740246528.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1ivohu2/i_want_a_girlfriend/

\--

Hi everyone,¬†

This is Sydney, the Term 1 ASIA 326 014 TA. I'm reaching out here on a throwaway since I'm not sure whether people will receive announcement notifications on old/archived Canvas pages.

While my initial course contract ended in mid-December, **I wanted to let you all know that the department has hired me to take on the overdue grading for both sections (013 and 014).** Sharalyn Orbaugh (the Asian Studies department head) and I received Canvas access as of Tuesday and will finish grading as quickly as humanly possible so that final grades can be uploaded to Workday.¬†

The department has been made aware of the discussion on UBC's subreddit and understands that many of you have concerns about applying for graduation, etc. **If you have time-sensitive reasons for needing your final grades and are worried about waiting for even 1-2 more weeks, please contact me or Sharalyn** (see final paragraph for email info) and we will do our best to help.¬†

Because the two of us are not privy to all of the communications that Dr. Blum had with students, we may be unaware of all of the extensions granted. **If you had an extension/accommodation on an assignment and want to confirm that it's already on our radar, please reach out as soon as possible.** Note that we will require evidence of the extension (i.e. screenshot of an email correspondence with Dr. Blum, etc.) and any attempts to retroactively fabricate an extension will count as academic dishonesty.¬†

Finally, as a student myself, I know how frustrating this process has been for all of you and I'm sorry that I wasn't able to do more to help everyone after my first contract ended. While the grading that I was responsible for was completed before the end of my TAship, I was limited in terms of how many additional hours I was allowed to work. Now that I am once again under contract I look forward to providing everyone with peace of mind, a line of communication, and--most importantly-- your final grades!

Don't hesitate to reach out via email if you have questions; you can find our email addresses in the canvas announcement I made and on the department website. **Please do NOT reach out via reddit dms**, which for ethical reasons I will not be responding to.

Best wishes,

Sydney
