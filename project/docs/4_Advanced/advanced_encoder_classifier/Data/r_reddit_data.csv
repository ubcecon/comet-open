1ivohu2,I want a girlfriend,Local_Nose_4945,"# That adorable TA love story made me both happy and lonely?? Where is my future wife😭

I just want a girlfriend who actually has hobbies—like *real* hobbies, not just ""going out to eat"" or scrolling TikTok for six hours. Someone who takes care of herself, doesn’t stay up until 5 AM every night for no reason, remembers to eat and drink water without needing constant reminders, isn’t just going along with whatever everyone else is doing but actually thinks for herself.

Values my opinions, is willing to grow and grow together, and sees value in having a family one day. Also, she showers (low bar, I know, but we’ve all seen things), treats service workers with basic decency, is kind to her friends and family, keeps herself active but isn’t obsessed with gym selfies, cleans her room AND her bathroom (and doesn’t leave enough hair in the shower to clog a drain every week), doesn’t keep Tinder for “validation” months into our relationship, doesn’t make me feel unimportant, respects herself, communicates when she’s upset instead of making me guess, doesn’t have a scary amount of Shein hauls, reads at least *one* book occasionally, doesn’t have to be a comedian but at least has a normal sense of humor, has actual life goals, isn’t just looking for one thing, doesn’t treat me like a trophy, has a social life but isn’t out clubbing 24/7, doesn’t try to make me constantly one-up her friends' boyfriends, texts like a normal human being, can cook at least something that is edible, enjoys active activities, likes being in nature, is financially responsible, doesn’t make fun of my insecurities, supports my goals and hobbies, doesn’t smoke or vape.

Econ 211 (macroeconomic policy), Econ 221 (intro to strategic thinking), Econ 234 (wealth and poverty of nations), Econ 255 (understanding globalization), Econ 317 (poverty and inequality), and  Econ 345 (Money and Banking).

For 234 I just want to know if its more economics and calculations than more history based.

It took me a few months to feel normal again but eventually I got over her.

I learned from it to not let anyone hold that kind of power over me emotionally again. Not to say close yourself off, but don’t give all of yourself to someone- and never become dependent on them for your mental/emotional health.

Be kind to yourself and allow yourself the time to grieve freely. i gave all of myself and i got pulverized Dw king you'll find someone better 🙏 Sending you support it’s tough🙏 Hey man, I feel for you. I’m really sorry that that happened to you. That shit sucks. I might be just a stranger on the internet, but I’m here for you. 

I have a basic rundown on advice I wish someone told me when I experienced my worst breakup. 

First, that shit sucks. Let it. It’s always going to. That shit mattered to you, and that’s okay. It’s not gonna be easy. It’ll probably be pretty difficult all things considered. You will remember. You will grieve. I wouldn’t avoid it. Let it happen when it does, and enjoy yourself when it doesn’t. Those things are pretty much unavoidable, and the more you try to avoid them, it’ll suck. 

But there are things that you can control. Like how you push through. I don’t really like the term “moving on”, because “pushing through” to me sounds more like what it feels like. Like moving through tar but instead it’s grief. But yeah, how you push through it and keep living despite the fact that it sucks. Even if you do literally nothing but eat once on a Saturday, you still pushed through. And that’s good enough. Because it won’t be like this forever. And the grief won’t always win. 

Alright I don’t wanna turn this into a lecture of feels lmao. And I don’t know if this’ll actually mean anything to you or help at all. But if it hits home or helps at all, my DMs are open. I hope it helps you. But no matter what, you’re not alone. I mean you don't have to give a person so much power over you who cares so little. They broke up last year and I moved on. Simple as that. We are barely adults, our whole life is ahead of us. You will find someone new.

I just want someone who has an actual personality, showers, doesn't follow tons of girls, is nice to service workers, is kind to his friends and family, doesn't have to be a gym rat but at least keeps himself fit, cleans his room AND his bathroom, is pro-choice, isn't secretly MAGA, doesn't have hinge on his phone 4 months into our relationship and tells me he forgot to delete it and refuses to download his data so i know he wasn't talking to anyone, doesn't make me feel unimportant, doesn't flirt with my friends but isn't rude to them either, respects himself, doesn't hide his feelings and tells me if he's upset, doesn't have like 20 pairs of shoes, reads books even a little, doesn't have to be funny all the time but at least has a normal sense of humour, doesn't even have to be tall as long as he's taller than me (i'm 5'6), has life goals, doesn't only want one thing from me, doesn't use me as his trophy girlfriend, doesn't stay home every weekend but doesn't go out every night either, isn't a super dry texter, drives, doesn't sprint to catch the bus only to miss it, doesn't have to be a chef but at least can cook some basic food for himself, doesn't have to be super athletic but at least likes playing sports for fun, likes being in nature, is financially responsible, doesn't make fun of my insecurities, supports my goals and hobbies, doesn't smoke or vape, and likes talking about tea 🤍

Woooooo 🎵🎵🎵 Wooooo Hi I fit all the criteria Thanks for saving my dog from the burning building yesterday bro You got it bro 😭 You forgot to switch accounts Thanks for letting me borrow your yacht earlier bro No problem bro thank you so much for reading stories to the kids at BC childrens hospital. your allotted time was only an hour, but it really meant a lot to the kids that you stayed 7 extra hours! Anytime you hate periods too Just found out about periods 💔 our queens have it tough 💔💔💔 Thanks bro for hitting that fadeaway contested 3 to beat the cavs in game 3 of the 2015 eastern conference semi finals Cmon man that’s too easy Thanks for saving me from that burning vehicle last week~ Aye bro thanks for helping with my ligma treatment dawg 🙏🙏🙏 Bro, thanks for single-handedly defending the chiefs in the Super Bowl **defeating the chiefs 🦅 If he sprinted and caught the bus would that be okay? YEA 14 years ago The Zolas were yearning to be all that you desire, and playing rly good music about it 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elouvvondwY Always sprint to catch the bus regardless (it’s a mindset) I would take the 49 home and if you miss it on the bus loop, you can actually run to the next stop past the ubc100 sign if you're lucky. İf the bus hits the red light right on time, you actually make it to the stop. Anyway, I was unlucky most of the time. Feels like I wrote this because this is the most relatable and realest thing I’ve read in a while 🤣 I met all your other criteria except sometimes I miss the bus :( That's the most important one 😡
I That’s a … seemingly sensible list of demands. I wish you the best of luck in your search. The bar is definitely in hell; because girl, all I want is a guy that is chill and actually keeps up and remembers our conversations… or even a simple “how is your day?” 

Maybe I’m just delusional tho how is your day? Not the best till you made my day and asked 😂 right!! tell me why my friend(?) at the gym (that’s too old for me) does this 3x a week and it’s making me kinda breakdown over the fact that i kinda caught feelings bc of this? can i have someone my own age that does this? Darn! so close to meeting all that! ikr? I am such a dry texter, sprint to buses I don't catch, and man, I haven't read a book since 2023. hi girl, all i can say is from previous poor experience with guys in our generation, i am becoming numb to this even though i do really want to get married and have a family one day. my life is full but i wish i could share it with someone worth my time Literally I keep thinking I'm gonna give up but then I meet someone cute and the cycle continues It’s not giving up, it’s coming to the realization that your life is probably a lot better without having to think about your extremely mid looking broke boyfriend who’s not even that caring [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Ngl attractive people are honestly dickheads most of the times Same... The kind of stories I hear from my friends and have experienced myself makes me want to invest in a house and a dog *only* instead of a man😭 What is actually wrong with dudes this generation? Im actually curious Don’t act their age emotional immaturity with many (not all). 

i was hurt pretty bad by someone i knew for a long time (friend of years) because he couldn’t communicate with me when he caught feelings and it scared him off. not only this but other experiences as well. They're not attractive enough I lost u at actual personality Teach her the quadratic formula G Raise your standards, girl! The bar is on the floor rn What's wrong with sprinting for the bus and missing it 😭 Idk it's one of my only petty icks LMAOO especially if they're wearing a backpack, but if they catch it then it's hot love how specific that is lmao a guy that meets all these demands probably would not date someone looking for a boyfriend on reddit. Sounds like she's just venting. I doubt anyone would seriously look for someone on reddit. Canada Man and Arts Girl got us all in the mood these days ngl. some people definitely do but she seems actually normal Ur prob not wrong but let girly dream 😭 These arent really high demands though. I would imagine any half decent bloke to be meeting those standards Looking at op’s post history, she’s a total red flag thats me but I sprint to catch the bus so you gotta find someone else Apart from the following a ton of girls i know a handful of dudes who fit all of the criteria


If we drop the running for the bus/driving i can think of like 2 more other than those What’s wrong with sprinting to catch a bus though? guys don't get baited the hidden conditions are probably handsome and a giver Also highly intelligent. Must be able to do long division in their head. And what do you have to offer? Why would I be asking for something if I don't do at least the same 😭 I agree with all of these except the driving one I don't want to give you any advice since that i dont wanna sound like mansplaining, but you gotta realize every time you add a criterium, the pool of people who qualify decreases exponentially, and also some of your requirements are contradictory. what? those conditions are easy to naturally satisfy actually? Well I am noticing that some people naturally do and some naturally don't, and that seems to dictate whether these criteria are easy or not to them.

I just don't like playing sports for fun and I think the gym covers my physical exercise. Maybe you like sports, but it would be a pretty big lifestyle change for me. New lore dropped Off campus most men will manage not to trip on your low standards > likes talking about tea

Yeah, tea prices just keep going up don't they... what’s wrong w having 20 pairs of shoes lol The next time you think of swiping left on hinge, go through this checklist, that dude probably fits all the criteria >okay just editing this to say that I only wanted to vent, please stop dming me to hit on me 😭

Yeah that was your fault LOL

Miss, you're on Reddit I just need an ABG that I can buy Bigway for (I'm 6'6"") i think the biggest thing is that boys of our age are just less mature than girls. emotionally and generally speaking. but good luck!! Welcome to the gym To be fair it’s not even like we know Canada man irl so we don’t even know if he’s a good person. (Canada man, if you’re reading this I’m not saying you’re a bad person, just that we don’t know enough about you to make that judgement.) I hate that I fit almost all of these except being in shape. I’m overweight cause I’m depressed, i’m depressed because I feel lonely, i’m lonely cause I’m not attractive, i’m not attractive cause i’m overweight 💀 Lose weight boyo! U got this 💕 Secret for weight loss: do weights instead of cardio! I find that cardio tires your body so much that you eat back even more calories I think I meet almost all requirements. So do you have a link to the boyfriend job application? Is it on workday or scope? [deleted] That’s stupid af you don’t even know what she is bringing to the table. Im not reading all that. Good luck tho lol Are you actually a student here or just looking for goon victims [deleted] All I want is a guy who knows what a run-on sentence actually is... how many bfs have u had. if less than 2 hmu ill take u 2 arcade in my sports car Lool I meet all the ctieria except I am kinda forced to stay home over weekends due to work ( I work at FAANG/big tech) and kinda became overweight due to work related stress but hired a peroneal trainer. I also make 200k+.

What do you bring to the table though? And where do we sign up for interview? 

Kinda explains why finding a date is getting more competitive than getting a well paying job. [deleted] 😵‍💫 Not ime [deleted] I'm just saying that in my experience guys who fit this bill lie on both ends of the spectrum

So certainly not 100% will be prolifers [deleted] Yeah for the record it's not me


But ditto speaking from personal experience only. We need a polisci kid here I think this counts as an example of a poetic device, because the list looks excessive at first but then you realize it's pretty normal stuff. I can't remember what that device is called though or if it's even a thing haha Maybe you should ask Arts Girl smh (happy for you bro) Hi I need an update after your first OFFICIALLY OFFICIAL date pleaseeee 🤍🤍🤍 Yeah they’re reasonable but I think even a really great guy would be missing 1-3 of these or more since everyone has flaws I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut I WANNA MEET HIS MOM JUST TO TELL HER HER SON SUCKS 😍 Livies at UBC??????
Woooooo 🎵🎵🎵 Wooooo Thanks for saving my dog from the burning building yesterday bro You got it bro 😭 You forgot to switch accounts Thanks for letting me borrow your yacht earlier bro No problem bro thank you so much for reading stories to the kids at BC childrens hospital. your allotted time was only an hour, but it really meant a lot to the kids that you stayed 7 extra hours! Anytime you hate periods too Just found out about periods 💔 our queens have it tough 💔💔💔 Thanks bro for hitting that fadeaway contested 3 to beat the cavs in game 3 of the 2015 eastern conference semi finals Cmon man that’s too easy Thanks for saving me from that burning vehicle last week~ Aye bro thanks for helping with my ligma treatment dawg 🙏🙏🙏 Bro, thanks for single-handedly defending the chiefs in the Super Bowl **defeating the chiefs 🦅 YEA 14 years ago The Zolas were yearning to be all that you desire, and playing rly good music about it 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elouvvondwY Always sprint to catch the bus regardless (it’s a mindset) I would take the 49 home and if you miss it on the bus loop, you can actually run to the next stop past the ubc100 sign if you're lucky. İf the bus hits the red light right on time, you actually make it to the stop. Anyway, I was unlucky most of the time. That's the most important one 😡
I how is your day? Not the best till you made my day and asked 😂 right!! tell me why my friend(?) at the gym (that’s too old for me) does this 3x a week and it’s making me kinda breakdown over the fact that i kinda caught feelings bc of this? can i have someone my own age that does this? ikr? I am such a dry texter, sprint to buses I don't catch, and man, I haven't read a book since 2023. Literally I keep thinking I'm gonna give up but then I meet someone cute and the cycle continues It’s not giving up, it’s coming to the realization that your life is probably a lot better without having to think about your extremely mid looking broke boyfriend who’s not even that caring [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Ngl attractive people are honestly dickheads most of the times Same... The kind of stories I hear from my friends and have experienced myself makes me want to invest in a house and a dog *only* instead of a man😭 What is actually wrong with dudes this generation? Im actually curious Don’t act their age emotional immaturity with many (not all). 

i was hurt pretty bad by someone i knew for a long time (friend of years) because he couldn’t communicate with me when he caught feelings and it scared him off. not only this but other experiences as well. They're not attractive enough Teach her the quadratic formula G Idk it's one of my only petty icks LMAOO especially if they're wearing a backpack, but if they catch it then it's hot love how specific that is lmao Sounds like she's just venting. I doubt anyone would seriously look for someone on reddit. Canada Man and Arts Girl got us all in the mood these days ngl. some people definitely do but she seems actually normal Ur prob not wrong but let girly dream 😭 These arent really high demands though. I would imagine any half decent bloke to be meeting those standards Looking at op’s post history, she’s a total red flag Also highly intelligent. Must be able to do long division in their head. Why would I be asking for something if I don't do at least the same 😭 what? those conditions are easy to naturally satisfy actually? Well I am noticing that some people naturally do and some naturally don't, and that seems to dictate whether these criteria are easy or not to them.

I just don't like playing sports for fun and I think the gym covers my physical exercise. Maybe you like sports, but it would be a pretty big lifestyle change for me. Lose weight boyo! U got this 💕 Secret for weight loss: do weights instead of cardio!

I just want someone who has an actual personality, showers, doesn't follow tons of girls, is nice to service workers, is kind to his friends and family, doesn't have to be a gym rat but at least keeps himself fit, cleans his room AND his bathroom, is pro-choice, isn't secretly MAGA, doesn't have hinge on his phone 4 months into our relationship and tells me he forgot to delete it and refuses to download his data so i know he wasn't talking to anyone, doesn't make me feel unimportant, doesn't flirt with my friends but isn't rude to them either, respects himself, doesn't hide his feelings and tells me if he's upset, doesn't have like 20 pairs of shoes, reads books even a little, doesn't have to be funny all the time but at least has a normal sense of humour, doesn't even have to be tall as long as he's taller than me (i'm 5'6), has life goals, doesn't only want one thing from me, doesn't use me as his trophy girlfriend, doesn't stay home every weekend but doesn't go out every night either, isn't a super dry texter, drives, doesn't sprint to catch the bus only to miss it, doesn't have to be a chef but at least can cook some basic food for himself, doesn't have to be super athletic but at least likes playing sports for fun, likes being in nature, is financially responsible, doesn't make fun of my insecurities, supports my goals and hobbies, doesn't smoke or vape, and likes talking about tea 🤍

okay just editing this to say that I only wanted to vent, please stop dming me to hit on me 😭    This is so funny to me bcs most of the demands are acc reasonable but there's so many and they're so specific 😭 I think this counts as an example of a poetic device, because the list looks excessive at first but then you realize it's pretty normal stuff.

Feels like I wrote this because this is the most relatable and realest thing I’ve read in a while 🤣 I met all your other criteria except sometimes I miss the bus :( That's the most important one 😡
I That’s a … seemingly sensible list of demands. I wish you the best of luck in your search. The bar is definitely in hell; because girl, all I want is a guy that is chill and actually keeps up and remembers our conversations… or even a simple “how is your day?” 

Maybe I’m just delusional tho how is your day? Not the best till you made my day and asked 😂 right!! tell me why my friend(?) at the gym (that’s too old for me) does this 3x a week and it’s making me kinda breakdown over the fact that i kinda caught feelings bc of this? can i have someone my own age that does this? Darn! so close to meeting all that! ikr? I am such a dry texter, sprint to buses I don't catch, and man, I haven't read a book since 2023. hi girl, all i can say is from previous poor experience with guys in our generation, i am becoming numb to this even though i do really want to get married and have a family one day. my life is full but i wish i could share it with someone worth my time Literally I keep thinking I'm gonna give up but then I meet someone cute and the cycle continues It’s not giving up, it’s coming to the realization that your life is probably a lot better without having to think about your extremely mid looking broke boyfriend who’s not even that caring [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Ngl attractive people are honestly dickheads most of the times Same...

i was hurt pretty bad by someone i knew for a long time (friend of years) because he couldn’t communicate with me when he caught feelings and it scared him off. not only this but other experiences as well. They're not attractive enough I lost u at actual personality Teach her the quadratic formula G Raise your standards, girl! The bar is on the floor rn What's wrong with sprinting for the bus and missing it 😭 Idk it's one of my only petty icks LMAOO especially if they're wearing a backpack, but if they catch it then it's hot love how specific that is lmao a guy that meets all these demands probably would not date someone looking for a boyfriend on reddit. Sounds like she's just venting. I doubt anyone would seriously look for someone on reddit. Canada Man and Arts Girl got us all in the mood these days ngl. some people definitely do but she seems actually normal Ur prob not wrong but let girly dream 😭 These arent really high demands though. I would imagine any half decent bloke to be meeting those standards Looking at op’s post history, she’s a total red flag thats me but I sprint to catch the bus so you gotta find someone else Apart from the following a ton of girls i know a handful of dudes who fit all of the criteria


If we drop the running for the bus/driving i can think of like 2 more other than those What’s wrong with sprinting to catch a bus though? guys don't get baited the hidden conditions are probably handsome and a giver Also highly intelligent. Must be able to do long division in their head. And what do you have to offer? Why would I be asking for something if I don't do at least the same 😭 I agree with all of these except the driving one I don't want to give you any advice since that i dont wanna sound like mansplaining, but you gotta realize every time you add a criterium, the pool of people who qualify decreases exponentially, and also some of your requirements are contradictory. what? those conditions are easy to naturally satisfy actually? Well I am noticing that some people naturally do and some naturally don't, and that seems to dictate whether these criteria are easy or not to them.

I just don't like playing sports for fun and I think the gym covers my physical exercise. Maybe you like sports, but it would be a pretty big lifestyle change for me. New lore dropped Off campus most men will manage not to trip on your low standards > likes talking about tea

Yeah, tea prices just keep going up don't they... what’s wrong w having 20 pairs of shoes lol The next time you think of swiping left on hinge, go through this checklist, that dude probably fits all the criteria >okay just editing this to say that I only wanted to vent, please stop dming me to hit on me 😭

maybe im just delusional tho how is your day not the best till you made my day and asked  right tell me why my friend at the gym thats too old for me does this 3x a week and its making me kinda breakdown over the fact that i kinda caught feelings bc of this can i have someone my own age that does this darn so close to meeting all that ikr i am such a dry texter sprint to buses i dont catch and man i havent read a book since 2023 hi girl all i can say is from previous poor experience with guys in our generation i am becoming numb to this even though i do really want to get married and have a family one day my life is full but i wish i could share it with someone worth my time literally i keep thinking im gonna give up but then i meet someone cute and the cycle continues its not giving up its coming to the realization that your life is probably a lot better without having to think about your extremely mid looking broke boyfriend whos not even that caring deleted deleted deleted deleted deleted deleted deleted deleted deleted ngl attractive people are honestly dickheads most of the times same the kind of stories i hear from my friends and have experienced myself makes me want to invest in a house and a dog only instead of a man what is actually wrong with dudes this generation im actually curious dont act their age emotional immaturity with many not all 

i was hurt pretty bad by someone i knew for a long time friend of years because he couldnt communicate with me when he caught feelings and it scared him off not only this but other experiences as well theyre not attractive enough i lost u at actual personality teach her the quadratic formula g raise your standards girl the bar is on the floor rn whats wrong with sprinting for the bus and missing it  idk its one of my only petty icks lmaoo especially if theyre wearing a backpack but if they catch it then its hot love how specific that is lmao a guy that meets all these demands probably would not date someone looking for a boyfriend on reddit sounds like shes just venting i doubt anyone would seriously look for someone on reddit canada man and arts girl got us all in the mood these days ngl some people definitely do but she seems actually normal ur prob not wrong but let girly dream  these arent really high demands though i would imagine any half decent bloke to be meeting those standards looking at ops post history shes a total red flag thats me but i sprint to catch the bus so you gotta find someone else apart from the following a ton of girls i know a handful of dudes who fit all of the criteria


if we drop the running for the busdriving i can think of like 2 more other than those whats wrong with sprinting to catch a bus though guys dont get baited the hidden conditions are probably handsome and a giver also highly intelligent must be able to do long division in their head and what do you have to offer why would i be asking for something if i dont do at least the same  i agree with all of these except the driving one i dont want to give you any advice since that i dont wanna sound like mansplaining but you gotta realize every time you add a criterium the pool of people who qualify decreases exponentially and also some of your requirements are contradictory what those conditions are easy to naturally satisfy actually well i am noticing that some people naturally do and some naturally dont and that seems to dictate whether these criteria are easy or not to them

i just dont like playing sports for fun and i think the gym covers my physical exercise maybe you like sports but it would be a pretty big lifestyle change for me new lore dropped off campus most men will manage not to trip on your low standards  likes talking about tea

yeah tea prices just keep going up dont they whats wrong w having 20 pairs of shoes lol the next time you think of swiping left on hinge go through this checklist that dude probably fits all the criteria okay just editing this to say that i only wanted to vent please stop dming me to hit on me 

yeah that was your fault lol

miss youre on reddit i just need an abg that i can buy bigway for im 66 i think the biggest thing is that boys of our age are just less mature than girls emotionally and generally speaking but good luck welcome to the gym to be fair its not even like we know canada man irl so we dont even know if hes a good person canada man if youre reading this im not saying youre a bad person just that we dont know enough about you to make that judgement i hate that i fit almost all of these except being in shape im overweight cause im depressed im depressed because i feel lonely im lonely cause im not attractive im not attractive cause im overweight  lose weight boyo u got this  secret for weight loss do weights instead of cardio i find that cardio tires your body so much that you eat back even more calories i think i meet almost all requirements so do you have a link to the boyfriend job application is it on workday or scope deleted thats stupid af you dont even know what she is bringing to the table im not reading all that good luck tho lol are you actually a student here or just looking for goon victims deleted all i want is a guy who knows what a runon sentence actually is how many bfs have u had if less than 2 hmu ill take u 2 arcade in my sports car lool i meet all the ctieria except i am kinda forced to stay home over weekends due to work  i work at faangbig tech and kinda became overweight due to work related stress but hired a peroneal trainer i also make 200k

I think the greatest advice I got was to do something that you enjoy( doesn’t have to be what you enjoy most) but it is what you are most good at AND it is a degree that will provide you the lifestyle you envision.

Realized I had a knack for history and international relations, enrolled in the Coordinated Arts Program and quickly pivoted to gunning for IR. 

Close to graduation, I realized jobs in the IR sector were few and far between (especially for folks with Bachelor's degrees only), and wasn't happy with anything I could get.

I'm picturing myself in the pouring rain having to get to my next class in a building that's on the other side of campus half an hour away, all my paper notes soaking wet same as my laptop in my backpack.

Can you ease my mind a bit and explain to me how people go about their lives on this giant campus, especially in bad weather?",17,24,2025-02-22 00:28:12+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1iv6aog/how_do_you_guys_survive_the_campus_with_all_the/,"Wear sensible footwear Invest in a waterproof backpack. I own a hiking backpack that is waterproof. While I didn't originally buy it to deal with the rains, it keeps my stuff dry remarkably well. Also, carry an umbrella on you at all times. Most students would either wear a raincoat or use an umbrella. The rain here on most days is just a light drizzle and won't completely soak you. unless we have an atmospheric river, cyclone, whatever else they call it which does happen here and there so investing in a good shell jacket is worth the money There are umbrella sharing checkpoints at various points on campus where you can pick up an umbrella, and as long as you return it within 24 hours you don’t get charged. mini umbrella and a little plastic bag to put it in so it doesn't make other things in my bag wet Water resistant backpack, umbrella with a longer backside (yes they exist), and thug it out tank it, bring an umbrella everywhere, skip class (personal favorite) Umbrella. Vessis, umbrella, raincoat. Extra pair of clean socks in your car or bag helps too. if you’re from anywhere that’s tropical or have experienced monsoon, trust me when i say this the rain here is extremely light in comparison 😭 i only really carry my umbrella during october/november since that’s when the rain tends to be ‘heavy’ but as someone who’s experienced rains in india and even the middle east, the rain here is pretty light and soft ! as long as you have some sort of waterproof jacket w a hood you’ll survive perfectly fine imo it's frequent rain but rarely heavy. you will live Waterproof backpack from an outdoors store like MEC or Atmosphere, laptop case with zipper to protect it from liquids and dirt, waterproof shoes like Vessi or rainboots, collapsing umbrella that lives in your backpack (open it up to dry at home and leave it by the door so you dont forget), plastic folder or binder for notes, and a good quality rain jacket.

Realistically speaking, the most important ones will be the rain jacket and shoes for your own comfort, the umbrella, and the laptop case. I don't see many people writing paper notes anymore but if that's your thing, then definitely invest in a good binder. Don't skip on the laptop case tho cause I've seen a friend spill her water bottle inside her backpack and her laptop was cooked.

Edit: Also, you're highly unlikely to be walking 30 min to your next class, especially as a first year. One of the longest walks you could make is Forestry to Buchanan which is around 15 minutes. Short answer:
Vessi’s 
Water resistant or water proof backpacks
A good hooded jacket. I would say get a mid size parka
And water repellent pants Get an Arc’teryx jacket, they’re the best Born and raised PNW babyyyy, it's in our blood.

Jokes aside,  most of us are from here, so we are used to it (to answer your question).

Love rain, it's so cozy and makes studying more relaxing. Not bad weather at all. It's also good for our water reservoirs and land. This sense of calm is how I go about my life (to answer your other question). 

In terms of management, If you're worried about your stuff getting wet , use an umbrella. Or, get a rain cover for your backpack. get a really good raincoat (with a hood) and you should be good. honestly, having my laptop in my cloth backpack isnt rly a problem with the rain but if you want to be really cautious get a laptop case and you should be good!! umbrellas do not work well !!!!!!!!! rain is often with quite a bit of wind so umbrellas just arent the way to go at ubc & like someone else said, a ton of us are local/provincial and very used to it.

  
(edit: it doesnt take more than 15 minutes to get around campus from any first year res either as long as you dont walk at a snails pace) Hella expensive but Arc’teryx jackets or get something with at least 10000mm There is literally no need to be stressed!! Just wear a raincoat! Don't use an umbrella or I will bite you Goretex Boots, an umbrella, and optionally a waterproof cover for your backpack. Tbh I find a windproof umbrella of appropriate size pretty much takes care of it. jacket + umbrella and all is good You buy an umbrella or waterproof backpack.  No such thing as bad weather...

Or, get a rain cover for your backpack. get a really good raincoat (with a hood) and you should be good. honestly, having my laptop in my cloth backpack isnt rly a problem with the rain but if you want to be really cautious get a laptop case and you should be good!! umbrellas do not work well !!!!!!!!! rain is often with quite a bit of wind so umbrellas just arent the way to go at ubc & like someone else said, a ton of us are local/provincial and very used to it.

  
(edit: it doesnt take more than 15 minutes to get around campus from any first year res either as long as you dont walk at a snails pace) Hella expensive but Arc’teryx jackets or get something with at least 10000mm There is literally no need to be stressed!! Just wear a raincoat! Don't use an umbrella or I will bite you Goretex Boots, an umbrella, and optionally a waterproof cover for your backpack. Tbh I find a windproof umbrella of appropriate size pretty much takes care of it. jacket + umbrella and all is good You buy an umbrella or waterproof backpack.  No such thing as bad weather... Carhartt jacket + hoodie under it, some nice water proof pants (or just leggings under my dress pants) and vessi shoes/Doc Martin’s unless we have an atmospheric river, cyclone, whatever else they call it which does happen here and there so investing in a good shell jacket is worth the money",February,22,Saturday,0,fear,"how do you guys survive the campus with all the rain    im starting at ubc this september and i am unironically no joke terrified of this gigantic open campus with the weather that vancouver gets im picturing myself in the pouring rain having to get to my next class in a building thats on the other side of campus half an hour away all my paper notes soaking wet same as my laptop in my backpack

can you ease my mind a bit and explain to me how people go about their lives on this giant campus especially in bad weather    wear sensible footwear invest in a waterproof backpack i own a hiking backpack that is waterproof while i didnt originally buy it to deal with the rains it keeps my stuff dry remarkably well also carry an umbrella on you at all times most students would either wear a raincoat or use an umbrella the rain here on most days is just a light drizzle and wont completely soak you unless we have an atmospheric river cyclone whatever else they call it which does happen here and there so investing in a good shell jacket is worth the money there are umbrella sharing checkpoints at various points on campus where you can pick up an umbrella and as long as you return it within 24 hours you dont get charged mini umbrella and a little plastic bag to put it in so it doesnt make other things in my bag wet water resistant backpack umbrella with a longer backside yes they exist and thug it out tank it bring an umbrella everywhere skip class personal favorite umbrella vessis umbrella raincoat extra pair of clean socks in your car or bag helps too if youre from anywhere thats tropical or have experienced monsoon trust me when i say this the rain here is extremely light in comparison  i only really carry my umbrella during octobernovember since thats when the rain tends to be heavy but as someone whos experienced rains in india and even the middle east the rain here is pretty light and soft  as long as you have some sort of waterproof jacket w a hood youll survive perfectly fine imo its frequent rain but rarely heavy you will live waterproof backpack from an outdoors store like mec or atmosphere laptop case with zipper to protect it from liquids and dirt waterproof shoes like vessi or rainboots collapsing umbrella that lives in your backpack open it up to dry at home and leave it by the door so you dont forget plastic folder or binder for notes and a good quality rain jacket

realistically speaking the most important ones will be the rain jacket and shoes for your own comfort the umbrella and the laptop case i dont see many people writing paper notes anymore but if thats your thing then definitely invest in a good binder dont skip on the laptop case tho cause ive seen a friend spill her water bottle inside her backpack and her laptop was cooked

edit also youre highly unlikely to be walking 30 min to your next class especially as a first year one of the longest walks you could make is forestry to buchanan which is around 15 minutes short answer
vessis 
water resistant or water proof backpacks
a good hooded jacket i would say get a mid size parka
and water repellent pants get an arcteryx jacket theyre the best born and raised pnw babyyyy its in our blood

jokes aside  most of us are from here so we are used to it to answer your question

love rain its so cozy and makes studying more relaxing not bad weather at all its also good for our water reservoirs and land this sense of calm is how i go about my life to answer your other question 

in terms of management if youre worried about your stuff getting wet  use an umbrella or get a rain cover for your backpack get a really good raincoat with a hood and you should be good honestly having my laptop in my cloth backpack isnt rly a problem with the rain but if you want to be really cautious get a laptop case and you should be good umbrellas do not work well  rain is often with quite a bit of wind so umbrellas just arent the way to go at ubc  like someone else said a ton of us are localprovincial and very used to it

1iuyyfd,Update regarding ASIA 326 grades,asia326throwaway,"TLDR: Overdue grading reassigned to the 014 section TA/the department head and being finished ASAP. Please reach out via email (contact info available in recent canvas announcement) with questions or to confirm previous extensions.

Hi everyone, 

This is Sydney, the Term 1 ASIA 326 014 TA. I'm reaching out here on a throwaway since I'm not sure whether people will receive announcement notifications on old/archived Canvas pages.

While my initial course contract ended in mid-December, **I wanted to let you all know that the department has hired me to take on the overdue grading for both sections (013 and 014).** Sharalyn Orbaugh (the Asian Studies department head) and I received Canvas access as of Tuesday and will finish grading as quickly as humanly possible so that final grades can be uploaded to Workday. 

The department has been made aware of the discussion on UBC's subreddit and understands that many of you have concerns about applying for graduation, etc. **If you have time-sensitive reasons for needing your final grades and are worried about waiting for even 1-2 more weeks, please contact me or Sharalyn** (see final paragraph for email info) and we will do our best to help. 

Because the two of us are not privy to all of the communications that Dr. Blum had with students, we may be unaware of all of the extensions granted. **If you had an extension/accommodation on an assignment and want to confirm that it's already on our radar, please reach out as soon as possible.** Note that we will require evidence of the extension (i.e. screenshot of an email correspondence with Dr. Blum, etc.) and any attempts to retroactively fabricate an extension will count as academic dishonesty. 

Finally, as a student myself, I know how frustrating this process has been for all of you and I'm sorry that I wasn't able to do more to help everyone after my first contract ended. While the grading that I was responsible for was completed before the end of my TAship, I was limited in terms of how many additional hours I was allowed to work. Now that I am once again under contract I look forward to providing everyone with peace of mind, a line of communication, and--most importantly-- your final grades!

Don't hesitate to reach out via email if you have questions; you can find our email addresses in the canvas announcement I made and on the department website. **Please do NOT reach out via reddit dms**, which for ethical reasons I will not be responding to.

Best wishes,

Sydney

1iv5e0b,my dad lost his job but ubc is my dream school,Objective_Outside_53,"i got into ubc sauder and i so badly want to go (im an international student) but my dad recently lost his job so our financial situation is bad rn, i was wondering if anyone knows of any emergency funds or financial aid i can request to recieve?",59,14,2025-02-21 23:46:02+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1iv5e0b/my_dad_lost_his_job_but_ubc_is_my_dream_school/,"Unfortunately ubc doesn’t offer aid to international students. You only get merit scholarships, and if you got one you’d have been notified at the time of admission. Unfortunately as an international student you won’t be even able to secure your study visa if you cannot demonstrate the ability the pay Hey, I'm also an international student, and I would really recommend you to reconsider studying at Sauder. UBC and Sauder are a great place to study, but it is not worth dropping almost 200k on an education if it puts your family in severe financial burden. As the other comments pointed out, financial aid is only available to domestic students, and even major international scholarships will only cover less than half your tuition without even considering the living costs.

Besides, I really doubt you would even be issued a visa if you can't show continuing financial ability to pay for a Canadian education. 

I dont mean to discourage you, but international students are basically cash cows to Canadian universities, and I just want you to know the reality of the situation. This right here. Real ass answer Also as someone who did their business degree at a lesser known Canadian university, I wound up at the same employers as Sauder grads anyway. Business is about networking. Don’t worry about the brand name on your degree if you hustle, think creatively, and broaden your network. If you only got accepted recently, you do still have a chance. All international student profiles (once accepted) are separately reviewed for merit based scholarships, which can take over a month.

Otherwise, I'm afraid as others said you won't be able to come, the Canadian govt requires proof of funds and the programmes you refer to are for Canadian citizens since they are funded by taxes If u don’t have 100% on every single course then the scholarship u get from ubc is useless for an international student, since ubc doesn’t offer IS loans then your best bet is work during summer And even then, finding work over summer in Vancouver or surrounding areas isn’t easy, especially for an international student with relying on public transit. Even McDonald’s doesn’t hire very often. I would recommend studying near you for a year, community college or whatever. THEN when financial stability comes round and you still want to go to sauder, apply for transfer. i got my acceptance in feb but i received my scholarships as an international student around March end so look out for those. maybe you can email them about your situation as well and hope they consider you more for the merit based scholarships! mine were enough to cover entirety of my first year + 80% tuition fee of year 2-4. so if you get those you will be set.

if not, maybe consider applying next year and taking a gap year? personally, i dont think its worth taking out loans because the job market is terrible rn, unless you’re in accounting then sauder is great!! Im pretty sure you could apply for merit and need based scholarships for international students. Student loans may also be an option. Im not sure if you would be able to get hour visa though

https://you.ubc.ca/financial-planning/scholarships-awards-international-students 
This link is for only merit, there are also merit and need based. Though they may not cover all of your expenses, it depends on how bad your situation is. 

Someone in my highschool who was BROKE and got a full ride scholarship in Harvard. Ubc is great but remember there are other colleges too. Study hard and you might get a full ride somewhere good enough. Its not impossible 
Gl soldier Honest opinion from a Sauder Masters grad:
1. UBC and RHL skimp out on scholarships especially if you have no international (read American/Canadian) work experience as an international student. The 2-3 people who did get scholarships before the program started turned out to be the least disciplined in our batch, bunking lectures at will, propagating gossip and groupism, and souring well-meaning students’ experience. So do NOT depend on Sauder, the most you can do is explain your situation via email but do not expect anything.
2. During times of an economic slump like the one right now, business programs do not retain as bang-for-buck value as tech jobs or skilled trades. You’re walking into major uncertainty, with no guarantee when you’ll be employed after graduation.

Take it as a blessing in disguise and aim for UofT, Queens, Ivey, or an Ivy League school in a year or two when things are stable for you. If I was you, I would find a job and work full time for a few years to save up for school. That's what I did as I had zero support from anyone.

And as another mentioned, I don't think it's worth it to go to school internationally just for business school (sauder). You're better off going to a school local to you. Especially since money is a concern. As an international student in Sauder, I think you should try at least take the first two years in a college and then apply to transfer to UBC Sauder for third year. Many students do that, because college cost three times less than UBC’s fee. You should research that path just in case you’re interested. Of course, it would be a lot better to be in Sauder since first year, since they will teach you how to improve your resume and cover letter, and there’s a tons of clubs to get involved and network. BUT, as someone already comment, you should be aware that us international students are cash cow for universities :(… Sometimes it has been painful for me to pay the tuition cuz it increases each year Honestly, I would recommend you apply somewhere else and then consider transferring to Sauder if you feel you can fund your degree at UBC and at the end of the day getting into sauder or any other university will still land you the same job.

1iv4d4i,When to tell my supervisor that I want to quit my PhD,Gameplayer50,"I’m in my second year of my PhD, and I’ve decided I want to leave the program. It’s not a decision I make lightly: my supervisor is one of the best people I’ve ever met, the pay is good, my tuition was included in the fellowship, and I used to love my research topic. But I’ve changed a lot since I started and no longer feel this path is right for me. I want to transition to a job where I can solve actual problems and feel like a more useful member of my community, and of course, earn more.

My main concern is figuring out the best time to tell my supervisor. I’m currently TAing some courses this term. Should I wait until the end of the semester to share my decision, or should I let my supervisor know sooner? I’m also unsure how stopping my research mid-semester would affect the fellowship I received at the start of the term—would I be required to pay it back if I drop out now? How about the tuition? Do I have to pay them back? Does anyone have similar experience?",14,6,2025-02-21 22:59:29+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1iv4d4i/when_to_tell_my_supervisor_that_i_want_to_quit_my/,"I suggest setting a meeting with your supervisor (ASAP) and discussing all of this there. Talk with your supervisor. It's one thing if they're abusive and you need to get out without retribution, but if he truly is good folk, talk with him first.

Master out if you can. I know you haven't finished 2 full years, but with the way the job market is, you want every advantage. That said, take a look at the type of jobs you want. If they require at least a master's, you're almost likely to have to have a PhD to be competitive. Your supervisor likely will also be a good source. Talk to them immediately. If you do leave, they will want to replace you for fall and it is admission decision season. 

Do see if you’ve done enough or can do enough to leave with a Masters. Talk to them as soon as possible. Tell them you plan to leave at the end of term. Use the time to wind down your research, tie up any loose ends, and maybe look for a job. Agree with this. Leaving at the end of the term is better for all of these reasons plus your fellowship. Leaving half way through a term is messy on all fronts. I would recommend speaking to a student academic support person in the faculty of grad studies. They can advise on a way through this and answer your questions before you tell your supervisor and start the process. It’s better to have your ducks in a row and understand the implications of leaving your program before you tell your supervisor.

Stop drop and roll When you do your morning routine, remember to go outside and touch grass, BEFORE you put on your pants. Priorities are key. You’re good!

If there’s a big earthquake remember to duck under the desk (and protect your neck), and count to ~~30~~ 60 seconds. Look for the proper ‘drop, cover, and hold on’ practice.

If there’s a big earthquake remember to duck under the desk (and protect your neck), and count to ~~30~~ 60 seconds. Look for the proper ‘drop, cover, and hold on’ practice.

Edit: 4.7 magnitude 😮 Felt it in Surrey Felt in langley felt in Oakridge Felt it in New west 4.7 in Sechelt. Felt it in Pt Grey Felt it in Port Coquitlam. Wasn't too strong here. House shook in Coquitlam.  Didn't wake up my cat though.  So on the Cat Meter - 1.2 paws It’s showing 5.1 from Squamish for me Every time we get little quakes I wonder if it's gonna be the big one and reevaluate all my life choices in a split second Am I the only one whose thinking ""Fuck it - now's your chance""? That was a definitely a thought for me. But my cat, who I owe my life to, was with me. She stared at me with wide saucer eyes the second the earthquake started and suddenly I could only think about getting her to safety This is so real. It’s the 3rd earthquake I’ve felt in the past couple months or so and this lasted a tad longer. There was a mental image of a wave just engulfing me in seconds. no it’s kind of scary that it could literally happen at any point😭 i always get scared :( i was taking a shit man and i really thought i broke the toilet 😭 I was also taking a shit and I thought I’d rather die than leave it unwiped 😭 LMAO I was too, thought that it was such an inconvenient time for it to happen… 😭 This cracked me up too good 😂😂😂😂😂 I thought it was just floor vibrations from upstairs until I saw all of my houseplants shaking Sorry yeah i was having sex Are you Mormon?

Edit: Switched to a 5.1! 4.8 now i moved here in 2021 and this is the first time i've been awake for an earthquake 😭😭 i'm at a heritage building that's weak as fuck so when it started shaking i just looked at the others like ayo are we okay yall that was scary 😭😭 It was my vibrator Damn!

Felt it from Kits I thought a car ran into my house Why the heck my roommate felt that but I didn’t 💀 Do we think there will be aftershocks? With one of that magnitude yes but it’s doubtful you’ll feel them not that you will feel. that was a tiny earthquake I was on top of the suspended theater in the nest, I thought I was gonna have to brace for impact I’m in Victoria Dr. Thought a wind hit my house my bad Thought my lack of sleep was catching on me as the walls shook 💀 I was on bed, thought my neighbours were going crazy Was talking with a prof when it hit, at first it felt like a truck passing by but then it lasted way too long and you could feel it coming and going like a wave, that's when I realized it was an earthquake. Some people started evacuating at first before coming back inside. 4.7 not very far from here. Just north west of the city. But a 4.7 everyone nearby will feel. Even I’m underground and the room shook for literally about a second and that was it.

Be sure to add your felt report: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000pfbs/executive It woke me up [deleted] Felt in my ass cheeks YES OMG I’m so scared is the big one finally coming cuz I need to know if I need to finish this essay or not Felt in Kerrisdale. Do you guys think it will happen again? Nope. All done for earthquakes. Relax now. I thought my neighbors were just having a really good time then came to my senses and hid under my desk not on campus rn so didn't feel it. how bad was it? not bad at all but a lot of people here have never felt an earthquake before hence the panic. it was rather small I felt nothing, was focusing on Overwatch Yup! M4.7

I thought a tree fell over near my house The door started shaking and I thought somebody was out to get me someone ask dr. simon peacock what this means for the big one Didn't feel a thing? I'm working on the ground floor of the UBC hospital and I didn't feel shit?? I heard that building is fucked if there's a big earthquake so when I got the alert I thought I was gonna die :0 Definitely an earthquake.. woke me up from my nap 🥱😂 Yeah, I felt it really strongly. My whole room in Gage shook. My stuff almost fell from the shelves 😭 Was talking with a prof when it hit, at first it felt like a truck passing by but then it lasted way too long and you could feel it coming and going like a wave, that's when I realized it was an earthquake. Some people started evacuating at first before coming back inside. I felt it! It was kinda strong at my location the last time I felt an earthquake at ubc I was in my dorm in ponderosa when it first opened. i felt off balance and thought there was something wrong with my can of monster. it was only when my window blinds smacked on the window that I was freaked out enough to run out of my room to find out about the earthquake. Yes For a second i thought its finally over i’m in the basement floor of one of vanier houses and i felt the shake like crazy Yup Wait does surrey not have one? Im not feeling a thing but my friend in van said she is… I felt it in surrey Oop- Felt in Burquitlam! The whole building shook 4.7 magnitude 5.1 9 km down in sechelt. Possible for aftershocks.

Even I’m underground and the room shook for literally about a second and that was it.

Be sure to add your felt report: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000pfbs/executive It woke me up [deleted] Felt in my ass cheeks YES OMG I’m so scared is the big one finally coming cuz I need to know if I need to finish this essay or not Felt in Kerrisdale. Do you guys think it will happen again? Nope. All done for earthquakes. Relax now. I thought my neighbors were just having a really good time then came to my senses and hid under my desk not on campus rn so didn't feel it. how bad was it? not bad at all but a lot of people here have never felt an earthquake before hence the panic. it was rather small I felt nothing, was focusing on Overwatch Yup! M4.7

I thought a tree fell over near my house The door started shaking and I thought somebody was out to get me someone ask dr. simon peacock what this means for the big one Didn't feel a thing? I'm working on the ground floor of the UBC hospital and I didn't feel shit?? I heard that building is fucked if there's a big earthquake so when I got the alert I thought I was gonna die :0 Definitely an earthquake.. woke me up from my nap 🥱😂 Yeah, I felt it really strongly. My whole room in Gage shook. My stuff almost fell from the shelves 😭 Was talking with a prof when it hit, at first it felt like a truck passing by but then it lasted way too long and you could feel it coming and going like a wave, that's when I realized it was an earthquake. Some people started evacuating at first before coming back inside. I felt it! It was kinda strong at my location the last time I felt an earthquake at ubc I was in my dorm in ponderosa when it first opened. i felt off balance and thought there was something wrong with my can of monster. it was only when my window blinds smacked on the window that I was freaked out enough to run out of my room to find out about the earthquake. Yes For a second i thought its finally over i’m in the basement floor of one of vanier houses and i felt the shake like crazy Yup Wait does surrey not have one? Im not feeling a thing but my friend in van said she is… I felt it in surrey Oop- Felt in Burquitlam! The whole building shook 4.7 magnitude 5.1 9 km down in sechelt. Possible for aftershocks. Keep your stuff safe and a good reminder that we are in an earthquake prone zone 
Felt in Victoria and Coquitlam Yeah I felt it too. It said it was a 5.1 from Squamish Was this offshore? Are there tsunami alerts? it was a tiny earthquake there will not be a tsunami lol Had pasta under the table It was!!! And yes!!! Nope 😂 I was either riding the bus or waiting outside for a bus.

Didn't wake up my cat though.  So on the Cat Meter - 1.2 paws It’s showing 5.1 from Squamish for me Am I the only one whose thinking ""Fuck it - now's your chance""? That was a definitely a thought for me. But my cat, who I owe my life to, was with me. She stared at me with wide saucer eyes the second the earthquake started and suddenly I could only think about getting her to safety This is so real. It’s the 3rd earthquake I’ve felt in the past couple months or so and this lasted a tad longer. There was a mental image of a wave just engulfing me in seconds. no it’s kind of scary that it could literally happen at any point😭 i always get scared :( I was also taking a shit and I thought I’d rather die than leave it unwiped 😭 LMAO I was too, thought that it was such an inconvenient time for it to happen… 😭 This cracked me up too good 😂😂😂😂😂 Sorry yeah i was having sex Are you Mormon? If so, nice timing bro! SAME I genuinely thought construction was breaking our building down This is wack bc how pond markets itself as earthquake proof lol Same, I'm grateful to be a light sleeper in these cases.
