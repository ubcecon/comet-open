    \ internship and then look for a job    hi everyone my question is as the title\
    \ i am in 4th year biomedical engineering and about to graduate however i have\
    \ never done an internship ive heard that in this job market it is incredibly\
    \ difficult to obtain a job especially without any previous work experience as\
    \ a result i am wondering what is the consensus regarding delaying graduation\
    \ for an internship\r\n\r\n  \r\nthanks    i would recommend delaying an internship\
    \  return offer puts you in such a good position in your last few terms at ubc\
    \ if youre able to you should definitely consider delaying if possible i understand\
    \ some people cant due to financial family or other reasons but if you have the\
    \ opportunity securing an internship can be really valuable for your future disclaimer\
    \ im not a ubc student or even in bc but i am a bme grad\r\n\r\nget experience\
    \ before you leave uni the biomedical engineering industry in canada is very small\
    \ and very competitive youll be competing against graduates with 12 years of internship\
    \ experience and junior engineers with fulltime experience who are out of a job\
    \ itll be very tough for you to convince an employer to take you on unless you\
    \ already have a network and connections took me 5 years to graduate from ubc\
    \ i did 16 months worth of internship which landed me a job right out of uni definitely\
    \ would recommend delaying the graduation to secure an internship"

    and the social sciences why isnt this the case for ubc considering theres like
    30000 arts students     ubc follows the north american tradition in which disciplines
    are divided into arts or sciences with separate schools for law medicine and business
    because psyc and econ subsidize humanities psyc econ polisci would be very happy
    to leave arts and form a separate faculty econ would probably be very happy to
    do that even on its own they bring most of the revenue my understanding is that
    the vancouver school of economics which offers the bie program operates somewhat
    separately from arts so there is already some separation for econ in every way
    that matters vse is just a department under arts im very happy that econ is under
    arts arts advising is way much better and supportive than that of vse what makes
    you say that in my experience vse advising has been 10 times more accommodating
    than arts advising arts basically told me to die in a hole each time i had to
    see them just be glad its not arts and sciences vs everything else i personally
    am in the arts to hopefully become a psychologist long term since science psychology
    istends to treat human nature very robotic if that makes sense my understanding
    is that the vancouver school of economics which offers the bie program operates
    somewhat separately from arts so there is already some separation for econ in
    every way that matters vse is just a department under arts im very happy that
    econ is under arts arts advising is way much better and supportive than that of
    vse what makes you say that in my experience vse advising has been 10 times more
    accommodating than arts advising arts basically told me to die in a hole each
    time i had to see them in every way that matters vse is just a department under

    \ an instagram page ubcwomenshealth that is dming followers with intrusive questions\
    \ that are mainly around male circumcision and strongly promoting it i dont have\
    \ any views on male circumcision but its pretty weird that theyre using the cause\
    \ of womens health to promote it just wanted to let any followers of the page\
    \ know theyre not an ams club btw i confirmed    troll or not that an ass thing\
    \ to do women health club advocating for a male genitalia procedure is wild i\
    \ wonder if it has to do with risk of infection during sex but like just advocate\
    \ for washing  because of that my idea is probably wrong but thats the only way\
    \ i can think of it being a womans business whatsoever there is no good reason\
    \ for genital mutilation dwdw i feel the same but was trying to think of any semblance\

    \ canadian medical association does not endorse circusmion as the increase risk\
    \ of stis can be mitigated through proper hygiene deleted the way its currently\
    \ performed on infants doesnt make much sense it should be an elective procedure\
    \ on adolescents or adults so they can decide for themselves infant circumcision\
    \ is mostly a cultural establishment i read the systemic paper in which you cited\

    \ comes from areas of the world where sti and hiv rates are high i have nothing\
    \ against individuals who choose to circumcized once they reach the age of consent\
    \ its your body its your choice but the idea such that there is overwhelming evidence\

    \ not substinate the need for male circumcision at infancy especially in the context\

    \ so they make that decision together deleted good point yeah but in their questionnaire\
    \ they didnt have a single question about women which is a bit sus oh damn yeah\
    \ wtf because its a creep who gets sexual satisfaction from it dont think its\
    \ actually a womens health club probably made as some sort of mockeryscreenshot\

    \  out of pocket omg me too like wdym how is this directly related to me  asking\
    \ via instagram dms is crazy and lmk if im wrong but this feels like an ethics\
    \ issue not a real club its some creep who sexually harassed you wtf do they give\
    \ a shit abt circumcision or not  like im a trans guy so sorry if im stupid but\
    \ you gotta wash that shit with water whether ur uncut or not  these people dmed\
    \ me too to ask if i was interested i thought it was just a student group trying\
    \ to get their footing without much experience so i said sure but i thought they\
    \ would send more informationa consent form or something with ethics info and\
    \ eventually a qualtrics link for the survey but they just sent the following\

# SetFit with sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [SetFit](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit) model that can be used for Text Classification. This SetFit model uses [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) as the Sentence Transformer embedding model. A [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) instance is used for classification.

The model has been trained using an efficient few-shot learning technique that involves:

1. Fine-tuning a [Sentence Transformer](https://www.sbert.net) with contrastive learning.
2. Training a classification head with features from the fine-tuned Sentence Transformer.

| fear     | <ul><li>'bioc 202 advice    i was just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to study for the course i was trying to do textbook problems however i find myself confused i was just wondering did anyone take notes from the textbook was this worth it or just advice in general on how to approach this course i hear a lot about this course being hard so i would like to prepare myself for it thank you    lecture content is enough being confused about textbook questions is normal for textbook questions the first time i might have to look at the answer key but ill mark it and revisit it before an exam i took it last year make sure you understand every detail of the concepts mechanism and focus on the tutorial questions youll probably get questions in the exams similar to the tutorial questions'</li><li>'is this mold ham breakfast sandwich from the corner store        it looks like it could be mold but the photos kinda blurry so it also looks like it could just be burnt stuff from the cooktop thats stuck to the food this happened to me  i think it might be pepper or burnt stuff as the other comment suggests i took one bite saw that and then couldnt stomach to eat the rest even though its probably fine this happened to me months ago and so its unlikely that they would keep selling mouldy products but then again this is ubc that thumb tho  damn whats wrong with my thumb  you look like you ate your nails as the appetizer before lunch ive never heard that one before nice lmao itll build character looks like grill marks if it tasted off then its mold if not then ur fine its give the sandwich some personality if that isnt mold this store needs to learn how to make a sandwich green cheese and ham  or cluster of pepper powder they usually charge extra for that  damn whats wrong with my thumb  you look like you ate your nails as the appetizer before lunch ive never heard that one before nice lmao you look like you ate your nails as the appetizer before lunch ive never heard that one before nice lmao ive never heard that one before nice lmao'</li><li>'my friends dont hear me    ive often felt like my friends subconsciously block out what i say during conversations when its not just 2 of us or maybe they do it consciously but when were together as a group i feel like everyone gets so into it with side conversations that when i try to butt in or add to it no one but myself is listening i wouldnt consider myself a quiet person either sometimes i even try to repeat myself a few times but they appear to have tuned me out completely it eventually gets embarrassing in public when strangers around you can hear you being ignored by your friends i saw someone on here a few weeks ago mention how theyve started to refer to friends in university as colleagues and maybe its time i try that too     they dont want you in their group or youve never been one of them in the first place either way theyre obv trash let them hang with each other whos equally toxic until one of them ends it find your own group or enjoy freedom'</li></ul>

owl i would avoid 8am at all costs esp for commuters plus 6730 allows you to miss rush hour which i think is a bonus thanks  will probably do that then 89 is actual hell\r\n\r\nthe nighttime classes will be chill and traffic will be much more manageable if ur driving laughs in 710pm classes  do they even still do those deleted i had a lab that ran 69pm last year i vaguely remember seeing a 710pm class either for term 2 or summer 2024 it was online though depends on how you like to plan out your dayweek if youd rather sleep in than get up at an ungodly time then 6730 might be better for you but if you see yourself preferring to enjoy eveningsengage in other commitments throughout the day 6730 might be limiting as well for example a lot of different club events on campus are held in the evening friends might want to get dinner etc neither is great to have as a commuter but youd have to wake up at something like 530am with the latter so i would choose the evening lectures unless youre accustomed to waking up that early third option dont do the class this term unless you absolutely have to get it done this specific term you lose more time out of the day if youre commuting by going to 8am lectures in typical traffic to ubc during 7am to 10am your typical commute is extended probably roughly 1020 minutes\r\n\r\nwhereas the roads are clear at 730pm albeit dark this time of year 630730 are manageable especially if ur like an hour away or smth youll be able to get all three meals at home with no crazy hurry the first one obviously 89 sucks ive done 6730 classes before and enjoyed them the big con is lots of clubs have events in evenings and if youre a commuter and have early classes the same day it may be exhausting \r\n\r\ni focus better at night so the later classes suit my productivity best an 8 am i personally would always skip and you have to wake up earlier to commute campus is less busy in the evenings and youre avoiding traffic it also made the class feel more intimate because only a few people were taking class that late and the building would lock at 5 so our whole class got after hours keycard access \r\n\r\nultimately it depends on your study habits if youre a morning person or night person but i really enjoyed my night class avoid 8am lol easy 6730 pm lecture and then during the day you can catch up on errands study gym etc ill probably come back from an 8 am class tired and ready to sleep as a commuter i prefer the 800900am classes because i dont like getting home super late either way the traffic is better so both are preferable to all your classes being midday imo depends on if its recorded and if theres participation marks for attendance like iclicker i have 1011 am and 83012 as my earliest classes rn so id prefer that since having 36 hour breaks between classes pisses me tf off i like late afternoonevening classes in summer tho  89 thanks  will probably do that then deleted i had a lab that ran 69pm last year i vaguely

| surprise | <ul><li>'who are some of the best math profs at ubc    title pretty much says it all but im wondering who the best math profs are note i dont really mean their courses but the professors themselves i think precollege ive had a pretty unhappy relationship with math but being in college and taking cs especially these last couple of years ive been a lot more inclined to learning and taking it on im ever so curious about higher level topics ode real analysis topology etc and in a way id really like to motivate myself and get a sneak peek at what learning advanced mathematics feels like especially when taught by incredible faculty\r\n\r\ni have taken a course with prof leung math 221 and he was very charismatic funny and his lectures sort of felt like all 250 students were huddled together and actually engaged wondering if there are any other professors particularly in higher level courses that made you feel particularly inspired or that you think are just awesome in general if you feel like you would attend another lecture by some professor even if you arent a student in their class anymore thats the sort of person id probably be interested in\r\n\r\ni gravitate a lot towards professors who have a very human way of communicating their ideas generally being super approachable well spoken and ones you can sort of tell are extremely talented themselves is this me saying i want help finding a ubc math professor to idolize no well maybe \r\n\r\nedit yall are the best super wholesome that you have your heroes in the math dptmnt writing all of these down for next semesters registration    colin macdonald such a great math professor but even better human second this colin is my goat his office hours were amazing if you have the chance to take any course with him or take with any other sections definitely try to go to his office hours meow 3 i love colin macdonald he taught math so good i swapped majors i love this man so much and yes pls go to his office hours he loves teaching best math 200 prof around hands down i remember that time he brought sourdough bread sliced in two different ways to teach us about integration everybody loved the bread for breakfast drago vinayak vatsal in all seriousness i like his lectures and hes super engaging but his exams are very tough seconded prof vatsal is literally lifechanging for many so based nike is my algebro nahid walji is one of the best professors for low level math courses  hes fantastic at explainigg in an intuitive way he also has a great voice and a good sense of humor\r\n\r\n\r\ni had him for math 220 and watched a lecture or two of his for math 101 and i cannot recommend him enough great prof the goat  the goat elyse yeager i love how well she explains topics and answers questions jim bryan my lord and saviour matthew coles is the goat the way he talks is concise and also sounds like an awesome math villain with his tone love his lectures peter harrington is easily the best prof ive had after taking 8 math courses sebastian picard is my goat this picard is amazing look no futher than picard sven bachmann may be one of those you are seeking great lectures with delightful enthusiasm and concise processes beware of the exams he participates in designing tho personally if were not for that i would have taken his course this term xd incredible lecturer but ive had nightmares about his exams before sabin ailana fraser ive literally had such bad experiences with the math department to the point i switched my major so i wouldnt have to do math anymore but ailana fraser was truly a light in a tunnel of darkness shes smart sweet and also teaches in a way that makes it so easy to understand and if every professor i had was like her maybe my path would be different right now shes great she writes about the gaussbonnet formula in this scientific american article   \r\n wow super cool love ailana shes truly a gem she was so good at teaching that i even answered questions in class i never do that especially not during a math class peter harrington already mentioned but matthew coles genuinely the only reason i survived math100 sebastien picard is pretty good peter in some sense harrington seckin demibras i had him for math 220 it was a smaller class only for math majors which maybe makes it easier but still by far my fav math prof hes very passionate great teacher for sure dragos ghioca colin macdonald and kalle karu are pretty good mark maclean philip d loewen neil balmforth was pretty chill ben williams took math 221 with him he has a great sense of humour and teaches very clearly he has a passion for math which he brings to the classroom his exam was challenging but fun  which i havent been able to say for previous math courses the goattt too bad he never replied to us on twitter  gordon slade for math 320321 is pretty good hes retiring though\r\n\r\nseckin is amazing but he was already mentioned\r\n\r\nhannah keese taught the 10m math major only sections for math 200 and 221 she was also great people recommend taking 223226 instead if you can though taking colin class got me thinking hard about switching to math ben williams  keqing liu was a cool prof in my mind personally\r\n\r\nhe got perfect notes and love to talk to you for a whole day about math fr if you enjoy some kind of old school teaching you would love him he is the guy who could teach real math to students i agree with your assessment of cool my friends and i thought he was hilarious and i also agree that he cares deeply and is enthusiastic about math \r\n\r\nhowever i found he was terrible at teaching especially for first and second year courses he cant quite explain in simple terms and he gets really riled up if some students dont listen and cant answer questions then he goes on a long rant about said crappy students instead of teaching to the remaining 95 who are there to listen \r\n\r\nthe funniest moment was when the lectures were always like 30 full then when i went for our first midterm the classroom was packed dr liu was like where you all come from ubco has better math profs imo second this colin is my goat his office hours were amazing if you have the chance to take any course with him or take with any other sections definitely try to go to his office hours meow 3 i love colin macdonald he taught math so good i swapped majors i love this man so much and yes pls go to his office hours he loves teaching best math 200 prof around hands down i remember that time he brought sourdough bread sliced in two

art majors are not impressed by you and you are not special dont act like you are above everyone and like the course and its contents are useless \r\n\r\nalso please dont ask professors unrelated science based questions that you know they wont know the answer to'</li><li>'do courses just stay on canvas forever    i still have courses from last term i starred the ones im doing right now to make it easier but just curious    usually they disappear sometimes professors dont remove them from canvas if you want to remove them you can manually do it yourself you can remove courses from your dashboard but the courses that have just stuck around cant be removed from your courses tab youd have to go to the instructor to end the course open canvas app \r\nclick all courses \r\nremove the stars from the ones you want to hide i still have access to a course from fall 2020 so yes some courses do seem to stay on canvas forever the courses stay until ubc replaces the lms  for example before canvas we had blackboard a couple of years after canvas came online it shut blackboard down and all the courses on it were gone\r\n\r\naccess to the courses for students usually ends sometime after the semester  so download anything you want to keep before that happens canvas are available for about 6 weeks after term ends by default unless profs change that date or unpublish the course as another comment notes you can hide the courses yourself if they are making things confusing the default access end for term 1 courses is january 31st  some profs may adjust this you can remove courses from your dashboard but the courses that have just stuck around cant be removed from your courses tab youd have to go to the instructor to end the course'</li></ul> |
| sadness  | <ul><li>'feeling marginalized at ubc    im a psychology major and sometimes i feel like i ended up in the wrong major partly because of the people in it im currently in my fourth year and strangely enough every year i seem to encounter at least one person in my major courses who is discriminatorynot overtly but in a marginalizing way these individuals often control or dominate conversations or discussions steering the narrative theyll ask others for their opinions like what do you think but will deliberately skip me or avoid making eye contact throughout the entire discussion\r\n\r\nwhats even more unsettling is that ive seen several of these people listed as researchers through hsp being actively involved in research with professors and they also tend to interact more with professors after each lecture\r\n\r\nits almost nauseating and my mental health has been worsening year by year because of these experiences ive also met many great people but the experience of being ignored like this is truly upsetting this trauma feels so deeply ingrained that its as if it has woven itself into the very fabric of my dna its also made it more difficult for me to speak up during discussions i cant imagine what it would be like if people like this became psychologists one day    i know exactly what you mean theres a couple undergrad researchers ik who are fairly insensitive they often have these positions as they have connections and have a different attitude from us \r\n\r\nwhat gets me most is they carry positions in infant studies  autismstress labs and i really wonder how their future work will be some people in psyc are simply not fit for the field with low empathy you havent experienced those people who say they are premed in a loud way they just want people to feel bad and but i know for sure those who keeps telling people they are premed couldnt make it into med school im a graduate student but not in psychology last term i had a class with lots of psychology students and i actually felt the same thing they are hardworking and actively communicate with the professor but when it comes to group discussions some of them skip me and that was really awkward it seems like they only care about themselves and have no empathy to others youre not the only one  girlbosscoded behavior i respect the psychopathy hi there im sorry about this experience  i can imagine how difficult it must feel to participate and speak up when others mistreat you or respond in prejudiced ways \r\n\r\nif youre looking for someone to talk to about how youre feeling you can book a free confidential\xa0oneonone support session\xa0with\xa0ams peer support they are trained to provide emotional support with issues ranging from school and life stress mental health challenges etc\r\n\r\ntheres also the ubc equity and inclusion office they offer advising and resources for students experiencing discrimination'</li><li>'how good is campusvision where should i get contact lenses     tldr i want to start wearing contacts is campusvision a good location to get them \r\n\r\nhello i am a ubc student with horrible eyesight  negative 8 prescription to be exact i currently wear thicklensed glasses that are very weak because they are plastic because of my constant fear of them suddenly breaking on me i literally cannot see without them i decided that its time to wear contacts i understand that ubc covers these under our health insurance has anyone ever gotten contacts from campusvision optometrist at the ams nest how good are they can they help me if ive never worn contacts before \r\n\r\nif not campusvision what locations would you recommend getting contact lenses from near campus is preferred but anywhere in metro vancouver is good too for context im an international student so i dont have an optometristgoto glasses store here\r\n\r\nthank you in advance     the optometrist right by the bus loop is where i get mine from havent haf amy issues'</li><li>'fruit fly problem in residence    im so tired i killed a total of probably close to 40 fruit flies in my dorm over the past 2 days and i dont even know the source i dont have any fresh fruit  food and certainly no decaying material in my room is anyone else in first year residence experiencing this i see a lot of flies in the hallway but i dont know how its possible for them to get into my dorm that fast considering i literally slam my door immediately every time i need to enter or leave which also should create a wind current strong enough to oppose their motion does anyone have any tips on how to get rid of them its like they are spontaneously generating what the hell     put out a bottle with a mixture of orange juice cider vinegar and dish soap  the vinegar  orange juice attracts them and the soap lowers the surface tension so they cant escape\r\n\r\nsecondly pour boiling water down your drains  they breed in the drains i dont have drains im in a first year single person dorm \r\nand thanks for the tip ill definitely try it out  although i dont have vinegar so im wondering if it would work without it go to hmart or save on and buy some trust me the mix that the commenter suggested will work i did it last week also in rez vinegar is really necessary it simulates the smell of fermenting fruit  it doesnt have to be cider vinegar but they are attracted to vinegar the combination with orange juice might work as a substitute for cider vinegar\r\n\r\nno drains  do you have no sinks at all nope we have communal bathrooms  ah  got it  good luck grab some vinegar packets next time you get lunch or dinner know any places where i can get some the dining halls dont have it  they should if you ask but they definitely have them at triple os foodhub market has it for cheap i think talk to housing   if you have a pest problem its important they know so they can address it put some balsamic vinegar in a dish plastic wrap the top and use a fork to poke holes set on counter watch them die they can get in but not out \r\nthey will also eat sweet soaps etc hey do u want some fruit fly sticky traps my old place had fruit fly problems too so i got some but dont rlly need them anymore theyre not the best solution but id be happy to share hey op i have everything to make a fruit fly trap if you dont want to spend your money buying vinegar and dish soap just shoot me a dm i live on campus btw so i can meet you anytime at your convenience do you have plants no plants either deleted i dont think flies sting  okay got another solution get a plug in ultrasound pest repeller on amazon or temu weirdly they only have the ultrasound version available and not the liquid one i had back home once you got the repeller plug it into your extension cord and just sleep or study the flies wont make noise or try forcing their ways through your door anymore i dont have drains im in a first year single person dorm \r\nand thanks for the tip

gather feast\r\n\r\n\r\ni havent tried gather and feast but i know on wednesdays open kitchen butter chicken is tasty    theyre all equally shit but i liked feast the most because it had scoopable ice cream sometimes and usually more of the stations were open but the best things ive ever eaten at ubc were at gather im forever an open kitchen hater feast over open kitchen yupp definitely not oc  imo\r\nnumber 1 will always depend on what theyre having that day and personal preference\r\nnumber 2 will be feast if feast isnt 1st due to how consistently 710 the burgers are\r\nnumber 3 is just wherever is closest id recommend checking the nutrislice app to see the menu before you go i like the one at vanier the best but i live im oc and im lazy so i just eat at ok lol
