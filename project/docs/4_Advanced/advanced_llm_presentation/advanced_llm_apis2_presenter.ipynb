        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced machine learning models designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the data they have been trained on. Examples of popular LLMs include GPT-3.5 from OpenAI and open-source models such as `ollama` or `huggingface`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications of LLMs\n",
        "Large language models have a wide range of applications across various domains. In natural language understanding (NLU), they excel in tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, and language translation, enabling efficient content categorization and multilingual communication. LLMs are also powerful tools for text generation, facilitating the creation of articles, creative writing, and summarization of lengthy documents. Additionally, they enhance conversational agents and virtual assistants, providing human-like interactions and support. Furthermore, LLMs play a crucial role in knowledge extraction, sentiment analysis, and automated coding, making them invaluable in fields like customer support, market analysis, software development, and beyond. In fact, what you are reading right now was created using an LLM!\n",

        "# Worked Examples: Natural language processing and sentiment Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "**Natural language processing** is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. It aims to enable machines to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. One category of natural language processing is **sentiment analysis**: the NLP technique used to determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text, also referred to as \"opinion mining\". It aims to classify text as positive, negative, neutral, or sometimes more granular emotional categories (e.g., anger, joy, sadness). Sentiment analysis is widely used for analyzing opinions, feedback, and emotions in social media posts, reviews, surveys, and other types of text data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Social scientists use sentiment analysis to assess the public’s reaction to government policies, decisions, and political figures, understand how public sentiment evolves during social movements, protests, or cultural shifts, and understand changes in collective behavior, as well as pick up on toxicity and radicalization in communities. For instance, Ederer et al. (2023) used LLM-powered sentiment analysis to classify posts by sentiment on the Econ Job Market Rumors (EJMR) online forum, finding that posts mentioning women or female pronouns (\"she\", \"her\", \"hers\") attracted significantly more hate speech, misogyny, and toxicity compared to posts directed at or mentioning men. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "The issue with traditional sentiment analysis, also called lexicon-based sentiment analysis, is that it groups sentiment based on keywords pulled from a dictionary of pre-labelled words. For instance, the sentence: *\"While Biden did win the election, the five-point difference in the actual election results and the predicted polling shows that pollsters are extremely unreliable, and are most often shills for a particular political party.\"* Under traditional sentiment analysis, this sentence would be labelled as negative, as the words \"unreliable\" and \"shills\" are present in the negative words dictionary, and no words are present in the positive words dictionary. However, while efficient, this makes traditional analysis inaccurate in the modern digital landscape, where sentiment is often obfuscated by sarcasm, humor, and missing context. For instance, consider the following tweet:\n",
        "\n",
        "*\"YouTube now officially allow advertisers to display ads while videos are paused... actual piracy sites have less ads than youtube now.\"* (@7RlNGSINHAND, 2024)\n",
        "\n",
        "The sentiment here is clearly negative, expressing frustration at the plethora of ads on streaming sites. However, this is only obvious to the (human) reader, who understands the broader context of the tweet. The tweet itself contains no wording geared towards a particular sentiment, and would thus not be picked up as negative using traditional sentiment analysis methods. \n",
        "\n",
        "This is the issue that LLM-powered sentiment analysis attempts to solve: by *training* a LLM on large amounts of pre-labeled sentences, LLMs are able to pick up on the context clues, sarcasm, and humor that makes analyzing sentiment difficult. In this section, we introduce two methods of sentiment analysis. The first uses the ollama model we used earlier, and the second introduces BERT, another LLM, created specifically for sentiment analysis tasks. "
