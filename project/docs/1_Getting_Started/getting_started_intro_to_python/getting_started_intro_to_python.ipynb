        "Sometimes in our analysis we can run into errors in our code. This happens to everyone - don't worry - it's not a reason to panic. Understanding the nature of the error we are confronted with can be a helpful first step to finding a solution. There are two common types of errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Syntax errors**: This is the most common error type. These errors result from invalid code statements/structures that Python doesn’t understand. Suppose Python speaks English, speaking to it in German or broken English certainly would not work! Here are some examples of common syntax errors: the associated package is not loaded, misspelling of a command as Python is case-sensitive, unmatched/incomplete parenthesis etc. How we handle syntax errors is case-by-case: we can usually solve syntax errors by reading the error message and finding what is often a typo or by looking up the error message on the internet using resources like stack overflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Semantic errors**: These errors result from valid code that successfully executes but produces unintended outcomes. Again, let us suppose Python speaks English. Although we asked it to hand us an apple in English and Python successfully understood, it somehow handed us a banana! This is not okay! How we handle semantic errors is also case-by-case:  we can usually solve semantic errors by reading the error message and searching it online.\n",
