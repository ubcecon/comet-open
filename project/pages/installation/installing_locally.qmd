We have designed COMET to be easy to use and install for a wide range of students. If there's one thing we know about teaching data and econometrics, it's that everyone finds their own routine and tools that work best for them. We encourage you to explore and try different things - see what works best for you!

-   For most students, we recommend using **Jupyter Notebooks** via a cloud server, called a *JupyterHub* which is the easiest to use, and the simplest to get started, since you don't have to install anything. See [Accessing COMET using a JupyterHub](jupyterhub_setup.qmd) for a in-depth explanation.

-   Alternatively, you can run JupyterLab directly on your device as a stand-alone application. See [Running Via Jupyter Desktop](jupyter_desktop_setup.qmd).

-   If you have experience with VSCode, or prefer using a general-purpose IDE, you can [install Comet using VSCode](vscode_setup.qmd).

-   If you have experience with **R Studio**, you can check out our guide [Using RStudio](rstudio_setup.qmd).

If you're not sure, start with the cloud-based option, then get more sophisticated in the future.
