    "Recognizing that grasping and applying critical sociological theory is not a primary learning outcome for ECON 325/326/490, this initiative would seek to inspire introductory-level critical thinking and invite students to develop **more** questions rather than teach, explain or answer questions of how, for example, notions of race/class/gender/sexuality/ability/nationality intersect with and are reproduced in data work. Prompting students into deeper levels of thinking could look like frequently linking resources for students to learn more about equity, diversity and inclusion practices in data science and short \"pop up\" boxes (like the one below) which could guide students through evocative questions that prompt criticality and ethicality.\n",
