    "“Sentiment analysis is the practice of applying natural language processing and text analysis techniques to identify and extract subjective information from text” (Hussein, 2018). As this definition alludes, sentiment analysis is a part of natural language processing (NLP) which is a field that exists at the intersection of human language and computation. Because humans are complex, emotional beings, the language we use is often shaped by our affective (emotional) dispositions. Sentiment analysis, sometimes referred to as “opinion mining” is one way that researchers can methodologically understand the emotional intentions that lie in a textual dataset.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">  🟠 At the heart of sentiment analysis is the assumption that language reveals interior, affective states, and that these states can be codified and generalized to broader populations. In her book, [Atlas of AI](https://katecrawford.net/atlas) the artificial intelligence scholar Kate Crawford explores how many assumptions found in contemporary sentiment research (ie, that there are 7 universal emotions, etc) are largely unsubstantiated notions that emerged from mid 20th century research funded by US Department of Defense. Rather than maintaining that emotions can be universally categorized, her work invites researchers to think about how emotional expression is highly contextualized by social and cultural factors and the distinct subject positions of content makers.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 🟠 Consider the research question for your sentiment analysis project. How might the text you are working with be shaped by the distinct communities that have generated it?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 🟠 Are there steps you can take to educate yourself around the unique language uses of your dataset (for example, directly speaking with someone from that group or learning from a qualified expert on the subject)?\n",

Maybe you are interested in understanding how people feel about a particular political candidate by examining tweets around election time, or you wonder what people think about a particular bus route on reddit. UGC is often unstructured data, meaning that it isn’t organized in a recognizable way.\n",

In the unstructured example on the other hand, there are many typos and a given sentence might include a positive and a negative review as well as more nuanced contextual information (ie, that the person had to buy an additional product to make the microwave work). While messy, this contextual information often carries valuable insights that can be very useful for researchers.\n",

Further, a contemporary sentiment lexicon might code the word “miss” as being associated with negative or sad emotional experiences such as longing; if such a lexicon were applied to a 19th century novel which uses the word “miss” to describe single women, then, it might incorrectly associate negative sentiment where it shouldn’t be. While sentiment analysis can be a useful tool, it demands ongoing criticality and reflexivity from a researcher (you!). Throughout your analysis, be sure to continually ask yourself whether a particular sentiment lexicon is appropriate for your project.\n"

Anyways, I did actually end up going to my family doctor, who checked my bp (which was normal, btw), but I did exhibit signs of withdrawal. Some background abt me, I'm not one to fw substances so it's basically impossible for me to experience + show signs of withdrawal. Since Workday launched yesterday, I have since experienced nausea, severe headaches, irritability and mood swings. I also had to take a sleeping pill to fall asleep (which I hadn't done in...ever). Here's to hoping these withdrawal symptoms don't persist tonight and tomorrow I guess.\n",

Anyways, I did actually end up going to my family doctor, who checked my bp (which was normal, btw), but I did exhibit signs of withdrawal. Some background abt me, I'm not one to fw substances so it's basically impossible for me to experience + show signs of withdrawal. Since Workday launched yesterday, I have since experienced nausea, severe headaches, irritability and mood swings. I also had to take a sleeping pill to fall asleep (which I hadn't done in...ever). Here's to hoping these withdrawal symptoms don't persist tonight and tomorrow I guess.\n",

How did you fix it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

I'm not sure if this is also the case with other faculties/departments.\\n\\nThis seems a little late for an update seeing how registration opens for us 4th+ yrs (and some 3rd yrs?)

       "12  Hey guys not sure if anyone has the answer but the UBC website says that a student must take at least 18 of the 30 phil credits with upper year credits. I thought i could take more than that but now work day is telling me I have to do 12 lower year credits (I have 6 so far). Does anyone know if that is real or is workday just giving weird infromation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "14  Update for anyone with the same issue: I emailed the course instructor to let them know workday wouldn\\031t let me register and they were able to put me in the class within the hour. \\n\\nSo back in March I registered for a summer course (term 2) just in case it wouldn\\031t work with my schedule for next year. Now that I\\031ve confirmed it will work with my schedule in the winter, I dropped the course on SSC. However, on workday it still says that I\\031m registered and it won\\031t let me drop the course there. This is now causing an issue as it says I am ineligible for the course in the winter because it thinks I\\031m currently taking it. Does anyone know if I\\031ll still be able to register for it anyway or if I can somehow drop the summer section on workday? Any help will be greatly appreciated!!! \\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "23  I was trying to register for courses today but while registering workday gave me errors saying that I would go over the 180 credit limit. I checked my total number of credits, and it seems that the transfer credits I have from high school are putting me over the limit and preventing me from registering for one or two courses that I want to register for. If the transfer credits aren't counted I would be far from the credit limit.  Is it possible to have UBC waive a portion of the high school transfer credits so I can take the one or two courses that I want to take without it spitting errors left and right due to too many credits?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

If you go on the UBC IT Outages Twitter (X) page, you'll see just the sheer volume of trouble that needs to be dealt with.\\n* Not to mention a backlog of IT service tickets that are not resolved (I have one that's weeks old and is still unresolved, marked as the highest priority).\\n* Many other institutions are using Workday, and UBC HR was already previously using it.\\n* UBC can now focus on problems other than the Workday system itself (like if the system is up or down) since Workday is a huge company with dedicated support specialists.\\n* Workday actually integrates a lot nicer on the backend, especially with managing data. Data are labelled nicely and functionality is better there.\\n\\nTransitioning has not and will not be easy, but when looking at alternatives, it was not a mindless decision, although it could have been executed better.\\n\\n**TL;DR: UBC IT can now focus on a ton of other problems instead of worrying about SSC.**\\n\\nThoughts?\n",

Turning the extension off revolves this.~~  should be fixed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "227 Both my friend and I have experienced this with two different classes so thought I would share in case this has happened to others without them realizing. When the course offering was removed from workday it deleted our entire term 1 worklists. Obviously if you don't notice this has happened before registration this can cause major issues. Not sure how common this is, but just a heads up in case.\\n\\nedit for clarity:  I'm talking about an entire course offering being removed from workday, not manually editing/deleting classes on a saved schedule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "228 If you look at my previous post, this post will make more sense. Anyways, I did actually end up going to my family doctor, who checked my bp (which was normal, btw), but I did exhibit signs of withdrawal. Some background abt me, I'm not one to fw substances so it's basically impossible for me to experience + show signs of withdrawal. Since Workday launched yesterday, I have since experienced nausea, severe headaches, irritability and mood swings. I also had to take a sleeping pill to fall asleep (which I hadn't done in...ever). Here's to hoping these withdrawal symptoms don't persist tonight and tomorrow I guess.\\n\\nedit: why is this post being downvoted so much?

       "240 Yes, I know Workday seems to be sh!tshow for pretty much everyone, but the ongoing \"General Wage Increase Payroll Error\" emails are especially galling for student employees.\\n\\nRead the backstory here:  \\n(Oct. 2, 2023) **Issues with UBC payroll operations frustrate student employees**  \\n[https://ubyssey.ca/news/issues-with-ubc-payroll-operations-frustrate-student-employees/](https://ubyssey.ca/news/issues-with-ubc-payroll-operations-frustrate-student-employees/)\\n\\nOf course, student employees might have noticed the over-payment if their payslips made any sense. As it stands, students with more than one appointment cannot tell **who** is paying them **what** from the information provided (the figures are lumped together), so it can be hard to tell if they are being under/overpaid or, at transition points between appointments, paid at all.\\n\\nThis is a known issue, but presumably not enough of a priority to fix. For now, if student employees want to decipher their payslips, they can submit a request ([https://ubc.service-now.com/selfservice](https://ubc.service-now.com/selfservice))  through a service now ticket with the pay date and a request for a breakdown of the pay. If enough student employees do this routinely, perhaps they'll address the issue rather than, by default, telling you to go figure it out yourself.                                                                                     \n",

       "247 Trust me, I tried. I tried several permutations of my required schedule but no, there is no way out. I'm only missing a \\\\*single\\\\* course which overlaps with another course, both are required, and there are no other sections available.\\n\\nJust why. Why are so many statistics courses without reserved seats for our own faculty. Why are there so few sections for another course so many people need to take. I'm in 4th year and unbelievably this is still a massive problem for me. In fact this year it seems worse because I'm out of alternatives.\\n\\nWhy is it, UBC, that when I chose you years ago, you not only put me through such misery but also compound it with something as vile as Workday?\\n\\nOh, and Science Advising has been less than useless.

I checked my course grade and It shows an F but I haven\u0019t received an SD on ssc or received an email that denied my request for the SD. I\u0019m extremely confused and idk what to do. Any help would be appreciated. I wrote my professors and email and will contact science advising today as soon as they open. Anyone knows what to do??

I\u0019m not currently in province so I can\u0019t go in person unfortunately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>UBC</td><td> 2</td><td>https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/15xjyo2/physics_and_astronomy_advising_not_replying/      </td></tr>\n",

       "I graduated from UBC a while back, but am currently applying for grad school programs which have January 2024 and May 2024 start dates. One of my professors from UBC agreed to write me a letter of reference back in the spring. We emailed back and forth a few times and had a few Zoom calls to talk about my goals/ the program, which I mention to make it clear that she seemed very committed to being a reference for me. After I submitted my application a month ago, I\u0019ve reached out to her twice and not gotten a reply. I think this is probably because she only teaches (has no research program) and therefore might only work Sept-April (I don\u0019t think she was teaching anything this summer based on the SSC, but does have classes listed on the SSC for this fall). I sent another email to her today, but I\u0019m very stressed out about the situation because the reference deadline is mid-September and I don\u0019t have a back up referee to ask. Does anyone here know when teaching faculty positions come back from the summer?

What she told me was that as long as I am in good standing (above 55%) at the end of the winter term 2, I just have to come to the arts advising office and let them know, and they will remove the credit restriction. So I spoke to her last week on Friday once I got all my grades on SSC.

I believe that's the limit if I want to increase the credit limit more than the normal limit, right? And like, this is very different from what the advisor told me - she was clear as long as it's good standing, it will be increased to the normal limit again. I don't know what to do now. I have taken 3 courses in one summer term before, and I'm not sure if it's the stressful environment or whatever, I end up performing much better in summers than I do in the winter terms.

I didn\u0019t leave my room for days except to give other exams in between. I could\u0019ve given the exam and still passed but I just couldn\u0019t bring myself to get up or do anything or even go out for a walk. So I felt like I had to apply for it but I still haven\u0019t received any information. I checked my course grade and It shows an F but I haven\u0019t received an SD on ssc or received an email that denied my request for the SD. I\u0019m extremely confused and idk what to do. Any help would be appreciated. I wrote my professors and email and will contact science advising today as soon as they open. Anyone knows what to do?? I\u0019ve never done this and I feel like crying rn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & UBC &  6 & https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1clcxuo/awaiting\\_standing\\_deferred\\_request\\_response\\_for\\_a/\\\\\n",

It'll be hard to get into courses I need then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & UBC &  7 & https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1d2q6js/year\\_4\\_promotion\\_not\\_met\\_says\\_on\\_ssc\\_what\\_do\\_i\\_do/\\\\\n",

       "I graduated from UBC a while back, but am currently applying for grad school programs which have January 2024 and May 2024 start dates. One of my professors from UBC agreed to write me a letter of reference back in the spring. We emailed back and forth a few times and had a few Zoom calls to talk about my goals/ the program, which I mention to make it clear that she seemed very committed to being a reference for me. After I submitted my application a month ago, I\u0019ve reached out to her twice and not gotten a reply. I think this is probably because she only teaches (has no research program) and therefore might only work Sept-April (I don\u0019t think she was teaching anything this summer based on the SSC, but does have classes listed on the SSC for this fall). I sent another email to her today, but I\u0019m very stressed out about the situation because the reference deadline is mid-September and I don\u0019t have a back up referee to ask. Does anyone here know when teaching faculty positions come back from the summer?

I did email the prof and the course email yesterday and today respectively but I don't really expect an answer cause its the weekends so they might not respond until monday,,,,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & UBC &  7 & https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1962hpl/late\\_grades/                                      \\\\\n",

What she told me was that as long as I am in good standing (above 55\\%) at the end of the winter term 2, I just have to come to the arts advising office and let them know, and they will remove the credit restriction. So I spoke to her last week on Friday once I got all my grades on SSC.

I believe that's the limit if I want to increase the credit limit more than the normal limit, right? And like, this is very different from what the advisor told me - she was clear as long as it's good standing, it will be increased to the normal limit again. I don't know what to do now. I have taken 3 courses in one summer term before, and I'm not sure if it's the stressful environment or whatever, I end up performing much better in summers than I do in the winter terms.

I didn\u0019t leave my room for days except to give other exams in between. I could\u0019ve given the exam and still passed but I just couldn\u0019t bring myself to get up or do anything or even go out for a walk. So I felt like I had to apply for it but I still haven\u0019t received any information. I checked my course grade and It shows an F but I haven\u0019t received an SD on ssc or received an email that denied my request for the SD. I\u0019m extremely confused and idk what to do. Any help would be appreciated. I wrote my professors and email and will contact science advising today as soon as they open. Anyone knows what to do?? I\u0019ve never done this and I feel like crying rn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | UBC |  6 | https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1clcxuo/awaiting_standing_deferred_request_response_for_a/ |\n",

It'll be hard to get into courses I need then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | UBC |  7 | https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1d2q6js/year_4_promotion_not_met_says_on_ssc_what_do_i_do/ |\n",

       "I graduated from UBC a while back, but am currently applying for grad school programs which have January 2024 and May 2024 start dates. One of my professors from UBC agreed to write me a letter of reference back in the spring. We emailed back and forth a few times and had a few Zoom calls to talk about my goals/ the program, which I mention to make it clear that she seemed very committed to being a reference for me. After I submitted my application a month ago, I\u0019ve reached out to her twice and not gotten a reply. I think this is probably because she only teaches (has no research program) and therefore might only work Sept-April (I don\u0019t think she was teaching anything this summer based on the SSC, but does have classes listed on the SSC for this fall). I sent another email to her today, but I\u0019m very stressed out about the situation because the reference deadline is mid-September and I don\u0019t have a back up referee to ask. Does anyone here know when teaching faculty positions come back from the summer?

I did email the prof and the course email yesterday and today respectively but I don't really expect an answer cause its the weekends so they might not respond until monday,,,,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | UBC |  7 | https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1962hpl/late_grades/                                       |\n",

That leaves me with 2 options, 1) Pay it using the 'Bank Transfer' function on the SSC or 2) Pay it using the 'Bill Payments' on the CIBC app after adding UBC Tuition as a payee. \n",

I went on to do 3 courses in the summer term 2 (july-aug). Then the course/credit restrictions were there, so in the winter terms for 2023-24, I did 4 courses in each winter term so a total of 24 credits.\n",

       "Now, I am back in good standing and my average was 66%. I had been speaking to an arts advisor for the last few months regarding how to proceed in summers, because I'm in my fourth year and wish to do my last 3 courses/9 credits in summer term 1 (may-june) and finish my degree. What she told me was that as long as I am in good standing (above 55%) at the end of the winter term 2, I just have to come to the arts advising office and let them know, and they will remove the credit restriction. So I spoke to her last week on Friday once I got all my grades on SSC. She said to just give it a few days and let the system update, and I will be able to register in the third course for the summer.\n",

       "I went again today because I'm still unable to register and I saw a different arts advisor this time, who told me that they can't give me the normal credit limit because I didn't give 70%, which isn't mentioned anywhere and was not told to me. I believe that's the limit if I want to increase the credit limit more than the normal limit, right? And like, this is very different from what the advisor told me - she was clear as long as it's good standing, it will be increased to the normal limit again. I don't know what to do now. I have taken 3 courses in one summer term before, and I'm not sure if it's the stressful environment or whatever, I end up performing much better in summers than I do in the winter terms. I'd really like to do my last three courses and finish my degree asap. Has anyone been in a similar spot?

       "3   Hello guys, I applied for a standing deferred request for a course\\031s final exam as I was severely depressed and stressed leading up to it. I didn\\031t leave my room for days except to give other exams in between. I could\\031ve given the exam and still passed but I just couldn\\031t bring myself to get up or do anything or even go out for a walk. So I felt like I had to apply for it but I still haven\\031t received any information. I checked my course grade and It shows an F but I haven\\031t received an SD on ssc or received an email that denied my request for the SD. I\\031m extremely confused and idk what to do. Any help would be appreciated. I wrote my professors and email and will contact science advising today as soon as they open. Anyone knows what to do??

       "12  Workday doesn't show the outstanding amount I need to pay, and SSC says that this feature is to be discontinued--so how the heck do I pay my YRH fees?

       "17  I don't know when and how this started, but the Duo login keeps showing up each month. However until last month I could still log in via phone. But just today when I opened SSC the phone call option disappeared so I downloaded Duo Mobile and it said to add your account using a QR code or activation code, the problem is I didn't even know I had an account and I don't think I have it. Any expert knows what to do in this situation.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85v2mwirvbzc1.png?width=458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb917388765e18de4561fcf77119cb5d4b7c52db\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

I know there's still time but I don't want to miss the July deadline for applying for Nov grad due to this admin/transition issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "23  i don't know why it's so bad. the course registration interface is awful. it's HORRIBLE. i thought it wasn't so bad before i tried to make a worklist there. do they not have eyes or something when they decided to opt for this instead of SSC? how is this an improvement??? it's such a downgrade. so inconvenient, i can't. can we bring SSC back                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "26  Hi! I was about to check my financial summary on my SSC this evening. Suddenly, I was redirected to a website for double verification. I entered my phone number and was asked to scan a QR code for the Duo app. When I reached for my phone to scan, the website accidentally refreshed, and I was brought back to the CWL login page. After entering my username and password, it asked for this code (attached image), even though I haven't set up Duo yet. Please, what should I do? I'm worried that Canvas will do the same thing, and I need to study for my midterm next week.

       "28  Do teaching faculty start their positions this week or next week, given that undergraduate classes begin on the 5th? \\n\\nI graduated from UBC a while back, but am currently applying for grad school programs which have January 2024 and May 2024 start dates. One of my professors from UBC agreed to write me a letter of reference back in the spring. We emailed back and forth a few times and had a few Zoom calls to talk about my goals/ the program, which I mention to make it clear that she seemed very committed to being a reference for me. After I submitted my application a month ago, I\\031ve reached out to her twice and not gotten a reply. I think this is probably because she only teaches (has no research program) and therefore might only work Sept-April (I don\\031t think she was teaching anything this summer based on the SSC, but does have classes listed on the SSC for this fall). I sent another email to her today, but I\\031m very stressed out about the situation because the reference deadline is mid-September and I don\\031t have a back up referee to ask. Does anyone here know when teaching faculty positions come back from the summer?

       "160 is it possible that my prof forgot to upload my grades onto SSC?? \\n\\ncause I asked a friend in the same class and he has already received his grades on SSC as well as the class average, I on the other hand have received nothing,,, no emails and no updates on SSC. I did email the prof and the course email yesterday and today respectively but I don't really expect an answer cause its the weekends so they might not respond until monday,,,,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "166 Please do note that there will be missing courses on SSC and vice versa. The terms that courses are offered in seems to be rather consistent at least.\\n\\nAlso, to the people that are saying it's easy to navigate, chances are that you probably belong to a department (and to some extent, year level) that makes it a lot easier to filter for your courses.

To find out the timeline for your method of payment please look it up on this webpage: [https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/finances/paying-tuition](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/finances/paying-tuition)\\n\\n**IMPORTANT:** As long as you pay by the deadline posted on your SSC for you specifically there should be no issues even if it takes a few days to show on your SSC. You are welcome to keep a receipt or screenshot of the successful payment for your records that you can provide if any issues arise, but UBC Vancouver will honour the payment date (the day the payment was made).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Or was it not supposed to be updated in the first place?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "176 Hoping this is just because not everything is set up yet, but does workday just not have any course descriptions/info tied to any of the courses yet?\\n\\nI made the unfortunate decision of not taking chem 121 or chem 123 in my first year, and I\\031m needing to take it for the upcoming winter session.

I also can't access the UBC self-service IT website because you need to login into your account to use it, which is the MOST REDUNDANT thing I've ever heard.\\n\\nI'm supposed to have a \"master code\", but was never given one when setting my account up. I have assignments due this week, as well as midterms, and I literally CANNOT ACCESS CANVAS. Someone please help, is there anything I can do?????                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "184 Hi, I'm an international student and I usually pay tuition via an international funds transfer but this time due to some reasons that isn't a viable option so I'm thinking about transferring the money to my account and and then pay it through that. That leaves me with 2 options, 1) Pay it using the 'Bank Transfer' function on the SSC or 2) Pay it using the 'Bill Payments' on the CIBC app after adding UBC Tuition as a payee. \\n\\nMy question for the first method is I'm not aware if there's any limit to student accounts on wire transfers, so I don't want to end up in a bunch of messy transactions. My question for the second method is I'm not 100% sure what is the exact payee name for the UBC tuition.\\n\\nI can't confirm either things until Monday when the bank and the housing office opens. So just wondering if either option is the better one to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "186 So I did really badly in 2022-23 winter term 2, and was on academic probation. I went on to do 3 courses in the summer term 2 (july-aug). Then the course/credit restrictions were there, so in the winter terms for 2023-24, I did 4 courses in each winter term so a total of 24 credits.\\n\\nNow, I am back in good standing and my average was 66%. I had been speaking to an arts advisor for the last few months regarding how to proceed in summers, because I'm in my fourth year and wish to do my last 3 courses/9 credits in summer term 1 (may-june) and finish my degree. What she told me was that as long as I am in good standing (above 55%) at the end of the winter term 2, I just have to come to the arts advising office and let them know, and they will remove the credit restriction. So I spoke to her last week on Friday once I got all my grades on SSC. She said to just give it a few days and let the system update, and I will be able to register in the third course for the summer.\\n\\nI went again today because I'm still unable to register and I saw a different arts advisor this time, who told me that they can't give me the normal credit limit because I didn't give 70%, which isn't mentioned anywhere and was not told to me. I believe that's the limit if I want to increase the credit limit more than the normal limit, right? And like, this is very different from what the advisor told me - she was clear as long as it's good standing, it will be increased to the normal limit again. I don't know what to do now. I have taken 3 courses in one summer term before, and I'm not sure if it's the stressful environment or whatever, I end up performing much better in summers than I do in the winter terms. I'd really like to do my last three courses and finish my degree asap. Has anyone been in a similar spot? Is there really no way I can register in three courses again?\n",
       "187 Anyone else having issues with logging into the SSC, viewing pages and DUO asking literally every time I try to logging from home even if I'm logged in and opening another tab.

    "The context implied by this post is that workday is unusable, and therefore, this student put together a Chrome extension to bypass some of the issues. However, nothing in this post is explicitly critiquing workday. The critique is implied through the context, something traditional dictionary-based sentiment analysis cannot do. "
