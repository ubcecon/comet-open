    "1. Be able to effectively use Stata do files and generate log files.\n",

    "3. Import datasets in csv and dta format. \n",

    "## Learning Objectives \n",
    "- Know when to use the following kinds of visualizations to answer specific questions using a data set:\n",
    "    - scatterplots\n",
    "    - line plots\n",
    "    - bar plots\n",
    "    - histograms\n",

    "- Use `graph export` to save visualizations in various formats including `.svg`, `.png` and `.pdf`\n",
