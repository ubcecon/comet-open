    "Understanding how to run a well structured OLS regression and how to interpret the results of that regression are the most important skills for undertaking empirical economic analysis. You have acquired a solid understanding of the theory behind the OLS regression in ECON 326. Here we will cover the practical side of running regression and, perhaps more importantly, how to interpret the results. \n",

    "One word of caution before we begin. Before conducting a regression analysis, a great deal of work must go into understanding the data and investigating the theoretical relationships between variables.  The biggest mistake that students make at this stage is not how they run the regression analysis, it is failing to spend enough time preparing data for analysis. \n",
