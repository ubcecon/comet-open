    "## 2.1 Introduction to Do-Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Do-files record the list of commands that we want to run for our analyses and allow us to run these commands directly from the file. When we run our analysis in a do-file we always know exactly what we have asked Stata to compute, which leads to far fewer errors. And we can easily edit the file whenever we want to make any changes to our analysis. Many times we will want to repeat the same analysis over and over again (say for subgroups of our sample) and using a do-file makes this straightforward. Finally and importantly for ECON 490, you can show you do-file to either your TA or your instructor for help and feedback. Many sections of ECON 490 require students to submit their do-files with their final paper. \n",

    "Log files save a recording of everything that appears in the results window when you run your do-file. Your instructor and TA will want to see your log-file whenever you have problems with your analysis and, as with the do-file, most instructors will require students to submit their log-files with their final research at the end of the term.  \n",

    "It is important to get into the practice of creating a log-file every time you run a do-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start every do-file with the command initiating the creation of a log. The command `log` tells Stata to open a log-file and create a record of what you type and any output that appears in the Results window. The command to start the log recording is simply `log using filename`, where `filename` is going to be the name the log will have when saved. \n",

    "    \n",
    "Given that your work is likely to be submitted online, you should also get into the practice of saving your log-file as a text file that your instructor can view on Canvas. To create a log-file as a text we use the option `text`. You probably will be overwriting the same log-file many times (i.e. each time you run the do-file) so you should also use the option `replace`. \n",

    "It is imperative that you close your log-file at the end of your do-file, or else the log-file will continue to record all your work and cause your do-file to crash next time you run that file. The command to close the log-file belongs at the very end of the do-file. \n",

This way you can avoid one of the most frustrating things about using do-files, which is that if your do-file crashes partway through a run, the log-file will not be closed. Having the log-file still open will then cause the do-file to crash a second time when the do-file is next run.\n"
