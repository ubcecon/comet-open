    "Imagine that we have constructed a dependent variable which contains the wage growth of individual workers and we see that some worker's wages increased more than 400%. We might wonder if this massive change is an coding error made by the statisticians that produced the dataset. Even without that type of error, we might worry that the wage growth of small number of observations are a driving the results we are obtaining. If this is the case, we would be producing an inaccurate analysis based on results that are not associated with the majority of our observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard practice in these cases is to either winsorize or trim the subset of observations that are used in that regression. Both practices remove the outlier values in the dependent variable to allow us to produce a more accurate empirical analysis. \n",

If that is the case you will want to consider including an interaction term that addresses that non-linearity. \n",

If we included this variable in a regression that also include an age variable that includes only years (e.g the baby's age would be codeds as 1) then we would have the problem of multicollinearity.
