In fact, there are often many versions of each of these files. You should start by creating a main folder or a \"root\" folder where _all_ your project files and folders are organised. Within the main folder, sort all your files into sub-folders similar to the structure shown below:\n",

    "* **figures:** contains all the graphs and figures\n",

    "\n",
    "So far we set the main directory in Stata, which in this case is the `fakeproject` directory. All the subdirectories in the `fakeproject` directory can be accessed using relative paths. Let's say we want to access a data file `fake_data.csv` in the `raw` folder nested in the `data` folder. The command using relative paths will look something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 16.6.4 Relative paths in other contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, once you are done generating variables or cleaning data, you can use relative paths to save it in the appropriate folder. For example,\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we started out in the `data` subdirectory and used relative paths to navigate through `raw` and `final` folders within the `data` folder. Using relative paths this way is convenient, but it can sometimes get confusing. This is bound to happen especially when you are moving in and out of subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "A robust solution in this case is to store file paths in macros.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.6.5 Macros (locals and globals)\n",

    "Locals store information within a code instance and disappear once the instance ends. Globals are store in memory until you close Stata, hence considered \"permanent\".\n",

    "global log_dir \"${proj_main}/logfiles\"              // Log-file path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define the key paths in globals, where `proj_name` and `proj_main` are unique to your project name and main directory, respectively. Note that `proj_main` includes the full directory path, whereas the rest of the subdirectories such as `datadir` are defined as relative paths `${proj_main}/data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In subsequent dofiles, we can completely skip defining the full file paths and use globals to make things convenient. Let's try importing our raw data file in Stata once again using relative paths defined in globals.\n",

This is especially true if you are working in a group, as you can choose to add the `cap` command (as shown earlier) alongside globals.

Within the curly brackets we include `cap log close` to ensure that any open log files from prior attempts are closed before we open the log file. Then we use `log using \"${log_dir}/2_descriptive.log\", replace` which generates a log file stored in the log directory `log_dir` (we defined this in the master file) and saved under the name `2_descriptive.log`. Finally, at the end of the script we include a command to close the log file. \n",

    "## 16.9 Stylized code\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a clear and consistent code style is a foundational skill that can sometimes bypass new coders.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three core practices that will make it easy to write, edit and understand your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding comments\n",
    "2. Splitting up your code into multiple lines\n",
    "3. Indenting and spacing your code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.9.1 Commenting\n",
    "\n",
    "> Instead of relying on your memory, leave a quick comment. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways to comment in Stata\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "* comments on individual lines\n",
    "\n",
    "// comments on individual lines and after some code\n",
    "\n",
    "/*\n",
    "comments on multiple lines\n",
    "like a \"code block\"\n",
    "*/\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a series of asterisks `*` to format your dofile and partition your code. In the `0_master.do` example we saw earlier, the directory settings were highlighted as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "****************\n",
    "* Directories\n",
    "****************\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting your dofile in this manner creates visual bookmarks and highlights different sections of your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use for comments is to \"comment out\" code that you might be testing or might need later. Use an asterisk to comment out a line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "*gen log_earnings = log(earnings)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or comment out a block of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "/*\n",
    "label variable workerid \"ID\"\n",
    "la var treated \"Treatment Dummy\"\n",
    "la var earnings \"Earnings\"\n",
    "la var year \"Calendar Year\"\n",
    "*/\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, leave comments before or after your code to explain what you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "* Open Raw Data\n",
    "import delimit using \"${datadir}/raw/fake_data.csv\", clear\n",
    "\n",
    "la var birth_year \"Year of Birth\" // label variable\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move on to writing more complex code, leaving comments will become exponentially more helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.9.2 Splitting the code across lines\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stata, we can split code across multiple lines using three forward slashes `///`. This can be particularly useful when making graphs. Let's see an example to understand why.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway (connected log_earnings year if treated) || (connected log_earnings if !treated), ylabel(#8) xlabel(#10) ytitle(\"Log-earnings\") xtitle(\"Year\") legend( label(1 \"Treated\") label(2 \"Control\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Making a graph has a lot of small components, and they are clubbed together in a single line of code. If we had to go back and change the number of ticks for the x-axis `xlabel(#)`, it is safe to say it might take us a moment to parse through all this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's format this code block using `///` to split it across multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if treated) || (connected log_earnings year if !treated) , ///\n",
    "    ylabel(#8)  xlabel(#10) ///\n",
    "    ytitle(\"Log-earnings\") xtitle(\"Year\") ///\n",
    "    legend( label(1 \"Treated\") label(2 \"Control\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it easier for you to find `xlabel(#)` this time around?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `///` is a simple step we can take to make code blocks appear neat and simple to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.9.3 Indent and space your code\n",
    "\n",
    "Using indentations in your code and spacing it neatly can improve its readability with little effort. You can use the `tab` button on your keyboard to indent and organise your code. Let's reformat the last example to see this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway                                              ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if treated)        ///\n",
    "    ||                                              ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if !treated)       ///\n",
    "        ,                                           ///\n",
    "        ylabel(#8)                                  ///\n",
    "        xlabel(#10)                                 ///\n",
    "        ytitle(\"Log-earnings\")                      ///\n",
    "        xtitle(\"Year\")                              ///\n",
    "        legend(                                     ///\n",
    "            label(1 \"Treated\")                      ///\n",
    "            label(2 \"Control\")                      ///\n",
    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same code block as before, but it is significantly easier to read this time around. Try to find `xlabel(#)` once again. Do you notice any difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not want to indent your code on such a granular level, as shown in the example above. That's okay, as long as the code is organised in a way that is clear to you and your collaborators, and generally easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.9.4 Putting it all together \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review a final example, that combines all the code styling tools we have discussed so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway                                              ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if treated)        ///     // log earnings, treated vs control group\n",
    "    ||                                              ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if !treated)       ///\n",
    "        ,                                           ///\n",
    "        ylabel(#8)                                  ///     // label ticks\n",
    "        xlabel(#10)                                 ///\n",
    "        ytitle(\"Log-earnings\")                      ///     // axis titles\n",
    "        xtitle(\"Year\")                              ///\n",
    "        legend(                                     ///     // legend labels\n",
    "            label(1 \"Treated\")                      ///\n",
    "            label(2 \"Control\")                      ///\n",
    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The comments in this example might seem unnecessary, since the code is self-explanatory. However, depending on your familiarity with Stata (or coding in general) and the complexity of the code, adding comments that seem obvious at the time can be helpful when you revisit your work days or weeks later. As students of economics, we understand that there is an opportunity cost to everything â€” including time spent deciphering code you have already written."
