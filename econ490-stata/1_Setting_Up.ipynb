    "Before you begin you will need to have installed Stata from the [UBC portal](https://ubc.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspxe). Please be certain to sign in using your CWL before searching for Stata. This software is free for all students in the UBC Faculty of Arts. \n",

With Conda we can create a particular directory folder (also known as environment) that will contain the packages that allow us to run Jupyter online notebooks which run code coming from different softwares (henceforth referred as kernels): Stata, R, Python, etc. The bare minimum for our environments is some version of Python. \n",

    "In order to execute the following commands on your computer, you will need to access your computer's terminal window. A terminal window includes a prompt that indicates where you will enter commands. The prompt you see depends on your own system, but it often includes the name of the host you are logged in to, your current working folder, your user name, and a prompt symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "How you access that terminal window will depend on your operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To open the terminal in Mac, do one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type \"terminal\" in the search field, then click Terminal.\n",
    "2. In the Finder, open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then double-click Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To open the terminal in Windows, do one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the Start button and select \"All Apps\". Scroll down the Start menu, right-click on the shortcut for Windows Terminal, move to the More menu, and select \"Run as administrator\".  \n",
    "2. Click the Search icon, start typing \"command prompt\", and then select Open or Run as Administrator from the search results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the terminal open, you can run the commands `conda` that can find packages to install from channels. This is not dissimilar to downloading software from a server. You want to make sure that the computer first finds the `conda-forge` channel. To allow this, you should run the following commands directly in your own terminal window in Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  conda config --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "  conda config --set channel_priority strict\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to create a package bundle, i.e. an environment, where you will install some version of R, Stata Kernel, and Jupyter. You can explore the things you can download to an environment from the  `conda-forge` channel by running, for example, `conda search r-base`, `conda search stata_kernel`, etc. That way, you can see that the terminal lists all the different versions of these packages that you can download from the different channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to create a new environment where we can install all these packages. In this particular case, we will create an environment based on Python 3.9.7. Let us create an environment called `stata_r_env` by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  conda create -n stata_r_env python=3.9.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you omit the `=3.9.7` part, you will create an environment with the default Python version. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want anything that we install from the channel to be part of this new environment. To do so, we need to activate it by running\n",
    "```\n",
    "  conda activate stata_r_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our environment is activated we can install everything we want. We begin by installing Jupyter, which will allow us to run the interactive notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  conda install jupyter\n",
    "```\n"
