    "Before you begin you will need to have installed Stata from the [UBC portal](https://ubc.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspxe). Please be certain to sign in using your CWL before searching for Stata. This software is free for all students in the UBC Faculty of Arts. \n",

With Conda we can create a particular directory folder (also known as environment) that will contain the packages that allows us to run Jupyter online notebooks that run code coming from different softwares (henceforth referred as kernels): Stata, R, Python, etc. The bare minimum that any environment needs to have is some Python version. \n",

    "Once Anaconda has been installed launch JupyterLab from Anaconda Navigator. You should be looking at something like this:\n",

    "![](img/anaconda_nav.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within JupyterLab click on the plus sign in the blue box on the top right corner and from the page that appears select \"Terminal\". All commands given below will be typed into that terminal window in the box that follows the $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terminal will runs the commands `conda` that can find packages to install from channels. This is not dissimilar to downloading software from a server. We want to make sure that our computer firt finds the `conda-forge` channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "To allow this, you should run the following commands directly in your own terminal window in JupyterLab:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  conda config --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "  conda config --set channel_priority strict\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to create a package bundle, i.e. an environment, where we will install some version of R, Stata Kernel, and Jupyter. You can explore the things we can download to an environment from the  `conda-forge` channel by running, for example, `conda search r-base`, `conda search stata_kernel`. You can see that the terminal lists all the different versions of these packages that we can download from the different channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to create a new environment where we will install all these packages. In this particular case, we will create an environment based on Python 3.9.7. Let us create an environment called `stata_r_env` by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  conda create -n stata_r_env python=3.9.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ommit the `=3.9.7` part, you will create an environment with the default Python version. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want anything that we install from the channel to be part of this new environment. To do so, we need to activate it by running\n",
    "```\n",
    "  conda activate stata_r_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our environment is activated we can install everything we want. We begin by installing Jupyter, which will allow us to run the interactive notebooks:\n",

    "```\n",
    "  conda install jupyter\n",
    "```\n"
