    "In ECON 325 and ECON 326 you learned that \"variables\" are individual characteristics that can be indicated by using data. For example, if we had a dataset that included all of the countries in the world, we might have a variable that indicated each country's population. Another example, if we had a dataset that included a sample of persons in Canada, we might have have variable that indicated each person's marital status. These are dataset variables, and they can be qualitative (numeric) or quantiative (strings). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a separate category of variables that are used in Stata that we call \"macros\". Macros work as placeholders for values that we want to store either temporarily or permenantly. Locals are macros that store data temporatily, usually while we are exectuting a do-file. Globals are macros that store data permanently, or at least as long as you have Stata open on your computer. Below you are going to learn how to use these tools in your own research. "
