    "## 5.2 Changing Directories \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started on importing data into Stata, it is useful to know how to change the folder that Stata accesses whenever you run a command that either opens or saves a file. Once you instruct Stata to change the directory to a specific folder, from that point onward it will open files from that folder and save all files to that folder, including data files, do file and log files (more on these later in this course). Knowing how to change the directory will make the way you use Stata more efficient this is because, Stata will continue to do this until either the program is closed or you change to another directory. This means that every time you open Stata you will need to change the directory to the one you want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  We write the directory path within quotation marks to make sure Stata interprets this as a single string of words. If we didn't do this, we may encounter issues with folders that include blank spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where have you saved the fake_data file? Lets change the directory to the specific location where the file is located using the command below! You can change your workspace to a directory named `some_folder/some_sub_folder` by writing `cd \"some_folder/some_sub_folder\"`."
