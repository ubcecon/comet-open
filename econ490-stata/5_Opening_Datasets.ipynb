In that sub-folder you will find two different versions of the same dataset: fake_data.csv and fake_data.dta. The dataset simulates information of workers in the years 1982-2012 in a fake country where, in 2003, a policy was enacted that allowed some workers to enter a training program with the purpose of boosting their earnings. We will be using this dataset to learn how to explore and manipulate real-world datasets. "

    "## 5.2 Changing Directories \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started on importing data into Stata, it is useful to know how to change the folder that Stata accesses whenever you run a command that either opens or saves a file. Once you instruct Stata to change the directory to a specific folder, from that point onward it will open files from that folder and save all files to that folder, including data files, do files, and log files. Stata will continue to do this until either the program is closed or you change to another directory. This means that every time you open Stata you will need to change the directory to the one you want to use. \n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
