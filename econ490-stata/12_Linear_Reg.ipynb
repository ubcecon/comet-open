Before conducting a regression analysis, a great deal of work must go into understanding the data and investigating the theoretical relationships between variables.

Furthermore, an extra year of age increase earnings by $\\beta_2$ on average. And we keep on doing the same for every variable in the list above. The econometrician (us!) only observe a subset of all these variables, which we call the observables or covariates $X_{it}$.

If these unobservables are correlated to a independent variable it means the variable can be causing a change in the dependent variable because of a change in an unobservable rather than a change in the independent variable itself, making us unable to prove causality. Notice that in the sample this is always true, because OLS by construction generates residuals that are uncorrelated to the observables. \n",
