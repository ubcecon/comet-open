The problem of causal inference is that we cannot observe both potential outcomes at the same time since each unit is either treated or not. When we have treatment $D_i$ that is good as random, these potential outcomes do not depend on $D_i$ (otherwise $D_i$ would have been correlated with $Y$). Formally,\n",

    "\\begin{align} \n",
    "E[ Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) ] &= E[ Y_i(1)] - E[ Y_i(0)] \\\\\n",

    "The punchline is that randomization is a great way to tackle the fundamental problem of causal inference: observing averages of counterfactuals. However, in *most* economic applications this will not be the case. The instrumental variables approach relies on finding something that is as good as random which affects the treatment and thus indirectly affects the outcome. The trick is to split the treatment into two pieces: one that is as-good-as-random and one that is non-random. We then use the former to estimate causal effects."

    "These two conditions imply that the instrument must affect the outcome $Y$ *only through* its effect on treatment $D$. A well-known example of this model is studied by Angrist and Krueger (1991). In their example, $Y$ is earnings, $D$ is years of schooling and $Z$ is the quarter of birth. The premise behind their IV is that students are required to enter school in the year they turn 6, creating a relationship between quarter of birth and schooling. At the same time, the time of the year one is born shouldn't  affect one's earnings aside from its effect on schooling.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Caution**: We can run 2SLS following the steps above, but when we want to do inference we need to be sure we're using the true residuals in the Structural equation $\\hat{u}_i$. When we do the manual approach, Stata will report the standard errors based on  $\\hat{u}_i +  \\hat{e}_i$, which is wrong. The solution is to use the built-in command `ivregress` or `ivreg2`!\n",

If it doesn't have any effect, notice that we don't solve the underlying issue of having an endogenous regressor.

In practice, this problem will result in severe finite-sample bias and large variance in our estimates.\n",

    "Recall that in OLS there is no way to test for exogeneity, $E[X_i u_i]=0$, because this holds exactly in the sample when we do the estimation. Similarly, when there is *only one instrument*, we are not able to test for the exogeneity of the instrument  $E[Z_i u_i]=0$, because this will be true by definition in the sample. \n",

The result of this is that over-identification tests can be really good for excluding some models (in this case, instruments), but they won't tell us if our model is actually good."

We learned that we can overcome the endogeneity problem when we have access to a different type of variable: instrumental variables. A good instrument must satisfy two important conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It must be uncorrelated with the error term (also referred to as the exclusion restriction principle).\n",
