    "In the previous notebook, we covered a basic estimating tool in statistics: confidence intervals. In this notebook, we will build on this knowledge and learn about an important inference technique, perhaps one of the most important concepts in elementary statistics: **hypothesis testing**. Hypothesis testing allows us to test expectations we have about data. We first create a hypothesis about some phenomenon (i.e. the relationship between two variables in our dataset). We then conduct a test to determine whether the sample data gives us credible reason to reject this initial hypothesis. This is a cursory glance of hypothesis testing. We will dive into the concept in much more detail throughout this notebook; along the way, we will rely on helpful built-in functions in R to make this process more convenient. As you go through this notebook, pay careful attention to not just the mechanics but also the logic of hypothesis testing. This is perhaps the single most important concept in elementary econometrics and so a careful understanding of this material will serve you well in future courses and beyond. Let's get started."

    "A hypothesis test always involves two hypotheses: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis (${H_0}$) expresses a default claim which is to be tested, while the alternative hypothesis (${H_1}$) expresses the contrary to the null hypothesis. Typically, our alternative hypothesis expresses what we may hope to prove about our data. Perhaps we suspect that the mean wage of Canadian men is $50,000 per year. As a default claim, we will assert the null hypothesis that the mean wage of Canadian men equals 50,000. Our alternative hypothesis will then express that the mean wage of Canadian men is not 50,000. If we find sufficient evidence in the data to reject the null hypothesis, we can argue with a certain degree of certainty that we should favour this alternative hypothesis. If we don't find this strong evidence, we accept the null hypothesis that the mean wage of Canadian men is 50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether we can accept this null hypothesis or reject it in favour of the altnerative hypothesis, we need two figures: a **significance level** (denoted by $\\alpha$) and a **test statistic**. The test statistic is a number we calculate from our data, which is a function of various features of that data such as its mean, standard deviation, and sample size. The significance level, on the other hand, is a probability that we choose at the outset of the hypothesis testing process. It is the probability of seeing a sample statistic (such as the sample mean for wages of Canadian men) in our data if we were to assume that the null hypothesis is true. Together, these two figures provide the criterion under which we can accept or reject our null hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common approaches we can use when testing a hypothesis: the **critical value approach (rejection region)** and **$p$-value approach**. Let's now concretely explore the steps in both approaches. Steps 1-3 apply identically to both the critical value and $p$-value approaches, and must always be followed. Step 4, the interpretation step, diverges between the two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with one important type of test: the **one sample $t$-test**.   This kind of test is used to evaluate statements about whether the population average is equal to a particular value - for instance, our example above with average wages being equal to $50,000.  This test is appropriate in situations where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The statistic is normally distributed: in the case of the sample mean, when  $n > 30$, invoking the Central Limit Theorem for normality, \n",
    "2.  We don't know the standard deviation of the population of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar to when we constructed confidence intervals for a sample mean when we didn't know the population standard deviation in the previous notebook. While a common type of test, this is just one of many possibilities for constructing a hypothesis test; however, we will use it as our example for brevity's sake as we go through the general hypothesis testing procedure. For a list of possible hypothesis testing set-ups, \n",

As a reminder, this is the probability of seeing the sample statistic we find from our data when we assume that our null hypothesis is actually true. We most commonly set our significance level at 0.05, or 5%. You will understand the importance of this number more when we reach the interpretion stage, but it is important to recognize that this value must be selected before running our test. One important note: remember in the previous notebook on confidence intervals that the confidence level is denoted as $1 - \\alpha$? Here, $\\alpha$ itself is the significance level, meaning that the confidence level and significance level add up to 1. It is important not to use these two terms interchangeably. They are distinctively different."

    "This is the most mathematical step, truly the only one requiring any calculation in the procedure. Our test statistic gives us a numeric benchmark under which we can accept or reject our null hypothesis upon interpretation in Step 4. Calculating the test statistic is quite quick, but it is important to understand the intuition behind it and how it is derived. Any time we calculate a test statistic, we use the same approach. We take our sample statistic, subtract it from the mean of our sampling distribution, then divide that all by the standard deviation of our sampling distribution. This will differ slightly depending on the situation we find ourselves in. The type of parameter we are making inferences about, as well as our sample size and the shape of our population distribution, will all play important roles in determining how exactly we calculate the mean and standard deviation of our desired sampling distribution; however, the general process outlined above will always hold for calculating a test statistic. As noted, we will look below at calculating the test statistic for one cases: one sample t-tests."

    "The above diagram, on the other hand, shows us how to use the critical value approach to choose whether or not to reject a null hypothesis for a two-sided test. There are now two red regions for this type of test, indicative of the fact that our alternative hypothesis is now $H_{1}: \\mu \\neq \\mu_{0}$. Again, if our calculated test statistic falls within either of these rejection regions, we reject our null hypothesis. If it falls within the white region, we fail to reject our null. Pay attention to the fact that in all three cases, the area of the total red region equals $\\alpha$, our chosen significance level. However, for the two-sided test, this area is split up. Considering that our test statistic will deterministically fall near (or in) either the left-hand rejection region or right-hand region, the probability that it falls within that specific region itself is now half as likely as it was for the one-sided tests (the probability is now $\\alpha / 2$). In this sense, the two-sided test is more conservative. It is less likely for our calculated test statistic to fall inside the rejection region and allow us to reject our null hypothesis. Thus, if we want to set up a null hypothesis against some alternative hypothesis we are hoping to prove, it is often safer to use a two-sided test. In this way, if we are still able to reject our null, we can be twice as certainty about the validity of our results. Thus, two-sided tests are often used to boost the confidence in one's results."

    "\n",
    "In this approach, we again use our test statistic to make inferences about our population. However, we no longer rely on the diagrams above. In this approach, we instead calculate what is called a p-value. This is the probability of seeing a value as extreme as the test statistic we have calculated (or more) under the assumption that our null hypothesis is actually true. In this sense, if our calculated test statistic is 2, the p-value is simply $Prob \\ (t_{\\alpha, n - 1} > 2)$, where we are using the student's t-distribution for a significance level $\\alpha$ and $n - 1$ degrees of freedom since we have been using the example of a one sample t-test throughout this procedure section. If this probability is small, it means that the probability of finding the test statistic (and thus sample mean) we have actually found is very likely under the null hypothesis being true. If this probability is smaller than our significance level $\\alpha$, we reject our null hypothesis. If the probability is not so small, at least larger our significance level $\\alpha$, we can reason that it is not incredibly unlikely to find the test statistic we have actually found under the null being true.

    "Underpinning both of these approaches is the assumption that our null hypothesis is true. For example, suppose our null hypothesis is that Canadian men have a mean income of 50,000, which can be expressed as $H_{0}: \\mu = 50000$; let's further suppose that our alternative hypothesis is $H_{1}: \\mu \\neq 50000$. Imagine we've chosen a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$ (5%) and calculate our test statistic to be 2 based on the sample mean, sample standard deviation and sample size we've collected. Let's say our calculated critical values are -1.5 and 1.5 (remember we have two critical values for a two-sided test). We notice that our calculated test statistic is more extreme than our upper bound (2 > 1.5). This tells us that, under the assumption that our null hypothesis is true, it is incredibly unlikely that we see a test statistic as extreme as the one we calculated. For good measure, we further calculate our p-value to be 0.02, meaning there is a 2% chance of seeing this test statistic under the assumption of our null being true. In both approaches, it becomes clear that it is quite unlikely that our original assumption, being that the null hypothesis is true, actually holds. We thus have strong evidence (in this case at the 95% level) to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis. Notice we never say that the null hypothesis is \"wrong\" or \"right\". Since we only have information about our sample and not our population, we can never say the null hypothesis is correct or incorrect. Instead, our hypothesis test gives us a certain degree of confidence in rejecting or failing to rejecting the null. In this case, we have 95% confidence in our ability to reject the null hypothesis. Let's now run through the hypothesis testing procedure more quickly with a few examples."

    "The `t.test()` function in R is helpful in that it allows us to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis immediately. This is because it outputs a p-value and test statistic. Our p-value is about 0.47, which is much larger than our confidence level of 0.05. This means that, assuming the null is true, it is very likely that we see a value as extreme as 57600. It is thus not bizarre to imagine pulling such a sample statistic when the null of 54000 is in fact true. This causes us to fail to reject the null hypothesis; however, to confirm this, we can also use the critical value approach. Let's utilize the `qt()` function below to do so."

    "We can see from the above that our test statistic of about 0.72 fits nicely within the upper and lower bound critical values of -1.98 and 1.98. Thus, again, it is very likely we see the sample statistic of 57600 we have actually found conditioned on the null hypothesis being true. We thus do not have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Further, we say that our findings of a sample mean of 57600 are not **statistically significant**. Statistically significant results are those which we find upon rejecting the null hypothesis. In this case, our large p-value and non-extreme test statistic prevent us from rejecting the null. If we received much different results (say a p-value < 0.05/test statistic very large in magnitude), we would say that the probability of finding the sample mean we did under the null being true is incredibly unlikely. This sample mean would thus be a statistically significant result which we could try with a high degree of uncertainty, allowing us to reject the null in favour of the alternative hypothesis. One final point about the p-value. In this case, the p-value was about 0.47. This does not mean that the probability the null hypothesis is true is 47%. It instead means that, conditioning on the null hypothesis being true, the probability of seeing a sample mean at least as far away from 54000 as 57600 is 47%. This is why we cannot reject the null and did not have statistically significant results. It is quite likely to pull a sample mean this large by chance under the given situation."

    "One thing that is crucial to remember is that our hypothesis test may not always be correct. While a hypothesis test provides strong evidence for us to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis, it is not concrete. That is why we never say that we \"accept\" the null hypothesis, instead preferring to say that we \"fail to reject\" the null hypothesis when no strong evidence exists against it. Similarly, we never say that we \"accept\" the alternative hypothesis, only that we \"reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis\". Neither hypothesis can conclusively be proven as true or false. Otherwise, we could calculate these parameters directly and there would be no need for constructing hypotheses about them! \n",

These errors are  called **type I errors** and **type II errors**. A type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis, otherwise known as a \"false positive\". This can occur when we draw a sample statistic which appears incredibly unlikely under the null hypothesis and then falsely assume that means our null hypothesis is incorrect. In reality, that sample statistic could have just been an unlikely pull under a true null hypothesis. Type II errors, on the other hand, occur when we to fail to reject a false null hypothesis, otherwise known as a \"false negative\". This can occur when we pull a sample statistic which is seemingly reasonable under our null hypothesis and falsely assume that we cannot reject the null. In reality, that sample statistic could have just been an unlikely pull which would have otherwise encouraged us to reject the null. A helpful infographic illustrating these concepts is below."
