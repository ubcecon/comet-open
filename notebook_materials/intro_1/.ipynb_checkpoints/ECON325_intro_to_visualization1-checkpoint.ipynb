    "In econometrics, good data visualizations should always answer a well-thought-out and relevant economic research question. A good data visualization should also exist as a standalone explanation - that is, it should provide readers with a clear understanding of both the research question at hand and its answer in a way that doesn't require further explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learn the iterative practice of making data visualizations, it's helpful to keep the following questions in mind as we make decisions about what to include/exclude in our graphic:\n",

    "\n",
    "Not only are data visualizations incredibly important as narrative outputs from data analysis, but they are also a beneficial tool to use iteratively throughout our analysis to identify patterns or anomalies as we process our data. We'll begin here with a few notes about best practices for visualizations.\n",

    "2. **Line plots** visualize trends with respect to an independent, ordered quantity (e.g., time)\n",
    "   * This plot works great when one of our variables is ordinal (time-like) or when we want to display multiple series on a common timeline\n",
    "3. **Bar plots** visualize comparisons of amounts\n",
    "   * This plot works great when we are interested in comparing a few categories as parts of a whole, or across time\n",
    "4. **Histograms** visualize the distribution of one quantitative variable\n",
    "   * This plot works great when we are working with a discrete variable and are interested in visualizing all its possible values and how often they occur\n",

    "\n",

    "> Important Note: generally, any aesthetic property which can be assigned in ```aes()``` can also be assigned to the ```geom``` directly.  For example, if you wanted to make a line dashed or a point red, you could do this by setting ```geom_point(color = \"red\")```.  However, this will apply to all parts of the ```geom``` so use it wisely!\n",

    "Let's start simple, and make ```x``` represent human capital, and ```y``` represent real GDP per capita.  We can start our visualization by creating our ```ggplot``` object and assigning all these properties:"

    "#### Exporting Visualizations\n",
    "Once we've decided that our graph can successfully answer our economic question, we'd like to export it from Jupyter. Once again, the `ggplot` package comes to our rescue with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ggsave` allows us to save a visualization using the following key arguments\n",
    "   * `(\"file_name.file_format\", my_plot, width = #, height = #)`\n",
    "   \n",
    "> You can check out an expanded list of possible arguments at the [R documentation page for `ggsave`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/1.0.0/topics/ggsave)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first part of the argument, `\"file_name.file_format\"` is where we give our graphic a descriptive name and specify which file format we want our graphic to be saved in the Jupyter workspace. If you are saving to a specific folder, you can add this before the file name with a `/` in between to delineate the two (example: `\"folder/file_name.file_format\"`). The format you choose may depend on the context you plan to use the visualization in. Images are typically stored in either **raster** or **vector** formats. The following definitions are borrowed from [_Data Science: A First Introduction_.](https://datasciencebook.ca/viz.html#saving-the-visualization) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Raster images** are represented as a 2-D grid of square pixels, each with its own color. Raster images are often compressed before storing so they take up less space. A compressed format is \"lossy\" if the image cannot be perfectly re-created when loading and displaying, with the hope that the change is not noticeable. \"Lossless\" formats, on the other hand, allow a perfect display of the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common raster file types:\n",
    "* JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg): lossy, usually used for photographs\n",
    "* PNG (.png): lossless, usually used for plots / line drawings\n",
    "* BMP (.bmp): lossless, raw image data, no compression (rarely used)\n",
    "* TIFF (.tif, .tiff): typically lossless, no compression, used mostly in graphic arts, publishing\n",
    "* Open-source software: GIMP\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector images** are represented as a collection of mathematical objects (lines, surfaces, shapes, curves). When the computer displays the image, it redraws all of the elements using their mathematical formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common vector file types:\n",
    "* SVG (.svg): general-purpose use\n",
    "* EPS (.eps): general-purpose use (rarely used)\n",
    "* Open-source software: Inkscape\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster and vector images have opposing advantages and disadvantages. A raster image of a fixed width and height takes the same amount of space and time to load regardless of what the image shows (the one caveat is that the compression algorithms may shrink the image more or run faster for certain images). A vector image takes space and time to load corresponding to how complex the image is, since the computer has to draw all the elements each time it is displayed. For example, if you have a scatter plot with 1 million points stored as an SVG file, it may take your computer some time to open the image. On the upside, with vector graphics you can zoom into / scale up the image as much as you like without it looking bad, while raster images eventually start to look “pixelated.”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second part of the argument, `my_plot` specifies which plot in our analysis we'd like to export.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The last key part of the argument `width =` and `height =` specifies the dimensions of our image. Because we've tinkered with the graph output size using `options(repr.plot.width = 15, repr.plot.height = 9)` above in our code, we'll want to use these dimensions as we export to ensure that our visualization isn't cut off by R's default saving dimensions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For the final section of this notebook, you'll make your own visualization using the Penn Data again.  Suppose you are tasked with building a visualization which explores the following question: **What is the relationship between the economic development of China and United States over time?**\n",

    "Some variables you might want to consider are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `year`: the year of observation\n",

    "* `pop`: population\n",
    "* `ccon`: real consumption of households\n",
    "* `avh`: average hours worked\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear: you don't need to use _all_ of these variables in your visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Start by deciding what variables are _essential_ and which ones are _optional_.  Choose at least two to include in your visualization.\n",
    "2.  Decide what kind of visualization you want to make.  Relate your choices to the best practices for types of visualizations.\n",
    "> You might want to consult the [cheat-sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) to see your options.\n",
    "3.  Finally, decide how you want to present it; what should the final product look like?\n",
