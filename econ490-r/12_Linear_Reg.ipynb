The biggest mistake that students make at this stage is not how they run the regression analysis, it is failing to spend enough time preparing data for analysis. \n",
    "- A variable that is qualitative and not ranked cannot be used in an OLS regression without first creating a dummy variable(or a series of dummy variables). Examples of variables that must always be included as dummy variables are sex, race, religiosity, immigration status, and marital status. Examples of variables that are sometimes included as dummy variables are education, income and age. \n",
    "- You will want to take a good look to see how your variables are coded before you begin run regressions and interpreting the results. Make sure that missing values are coded a \".\" and not some value (such as \"99\"). Also, check that qualitative ranked variables are coded in the way you expect (e.g. higher education is coded with a larger number). If you do not do this you could be misinterpreting your results.\n",
    "- Some samples are not proper representations of the population and must be weighted accordingly (we will deal with this in depth later).\n",
    "- You should always think about the theoretical relationship between your variables before you start your regression analysis: Does economic theory predict a linear relationship? Independence between explanatory terms, or is there possibly an interaction?\n"

    "An econometric model describes an equation (or set of equations) that impose some structure on how the data was generated. The most natural way to describe statistical information is the mean. Therefore, we typically model the mean of a (dependent) variable and how it can depend on different factors (independent variables or covariates). The easiest way to describe a relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, x is linearly. \n",

    "For simplicity, lets assume we want to predict earnings but we only have access to datasets relating to people's age and earnings. If we want to generate a model that predicted the relationship between these two variables we could create a linear model where the dependent variable (y) would be annual earnings, the independent variable (x) would be age, the slope (m) would be how much an extra year of age affects earnings, and the y-intercept (b) would be earning when age is equal to 0. We would write this relationship as,\n",

This term is the interpretation of the constant in our linear model. The re-defined unobservable term is a deviation from such mean, which we expect to be zero on average. \n",

We can use these in a formula (also known as an estimator!) to obtain a reasonable guess of the true $\\beta$s. For a given sample, the numbers that are thrown by the estimator or formula are known as estimates. One of the most powerful estimators out there is the Ordinary Least Squares Estimator (OLS).\n",

    "### 12.4.3 Sample Weights\n",
    "The data that is provided to us is often not statistically representative of the  population as a whole. This is because the agencies that collect data (like Statistics Canada) often decide to over-sample some segments of the population. They do this to ensure that there is a large enough sample size of subgroups of the population to conduct meaningful statistical analysis of those sub-populations. For example, the population of Indigenous identity in Canada accounts for approximately 5% of the total population. If we took a representative sample of 10,000 Canadians, there would only be 500 people who identified as Indigenous in the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "This creates two problems. The first is that this is is not a large enough sample to undertake any meaningful analysis of characteristics of the Indigenous population in Canada. The second is that when the sample is this this small, it might be possible for researchers to identify individuals in data. This would be extremely unethical, and Stats Canada works hard to make sure that data remains anonymized. \n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this issue, Statistics Canada over-samples people of Indigenous identity when they collect data. For example, they might survey 1000 people of Indigenous identity so that those people now account for 10% of observations in the sample. This would allow researchers who want to specifically look at the experiences of Indigenous people to conduct reliable research, and maintain the anonymity of the individuals represented by the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use this whole sample of 10,000, however, the data is no longer nationally representative since it overstates the share of the population of Indigenous identity - 10% instead of 5%. This sounds like a complex problem to resolve, but the solution is provided by the statistical agency that created the data in the form of \"sample weights\" that can be used to recreate data that is nationally representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Before applying any weights in your regression, it is important that you read the user guide that comes with your data to see how weights should be applied.

    "Often, after weighting our sample, the coefficients from our regression will change in magnitude. In these cases, there was some sub-sample of the population that was over-represented in the data and skewed the results of the unweighted regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, while this section described the use of weighted regressions, it is important to know that there are many times we might want to apply weights to our sample that have nothing to do with running regressions. For example, if we wanted to calculate the mean of a variable using data from a skewed sample, we would want to make sure to use the weighted mean. While `mean` is used in R to calculate means, R also has an incredibly useful command called `weighted.mean` which directly weights observations to calculate the weighted mean. Many packages exist which can calculate the weighted form of numerous other summary statistics."

    "\n",
    "Notice that OLS gives us a linear approximation to the conditional mean of some dependent variable given some observables. We can use this information for prediction: if we had different observables how does the expected mean would differ? Another thing we could do with OLS is discuss causality: how does manipulating one variable impacts the dependent variable on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a causal interpretation to our OLS estimates we require that in the population it holds that \n",
    "$\\mathbf{E}[X_i u_i] = 0$, the unobservables are uncorrelated to the independent variables of the equation (remember this is untestable because we cannot compute the expectations in practice!). If these unobservables are correlated to a independent variable it means the variable can be causing a change in the dependent variable because of a change in an unobservable rather than a change in the independent variable itself, making us unable to prove causality. This is also called an endogeneity problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be tempted to think that we can test this using the sample version $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j}^n  X_i u_i = 0$, but notice that from the first order conditions this is true by construction! It's by design a circular argument: we are assuming that it holds true when we compute the solution to OLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we want to interpret in the previous regression that the causal effect of being treated is equal to -0.81 it must be the case that treatment is not correlated (in the population sense) to the error term. However, it could be the case that treated workers are the ones that usually perform worse at their job, and that would invalidate a causal interpretation of our OLS estimates.\n",

If we include a covariate of working at a high paying job, then we're blocking part of the causal channel between college and earnings, i.e. you are more likely to have a nice job if you study more years!\n",
