    "##  5.1 Generating Dummy Variables\n",
    "The most common type of variable we will create during data cleaning and analysis is the dummy variable. Dummy variables are variables that can only take on two values: 0 and 1. It is useful to think of a dummy variable as being the answer to a question that can be answered \"yes\" or \"no\". With a dummy variable the answer yes is coded as \"1\" and no is coded as \"0\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of question that are used to create dummy variables can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is the person female? Females are coded \"1\" and males are coded \"0\".\n",
    "2. Does the person have a university degree? People with a university degree are coded \"1\" and everyone else is coded \"0\".\n",
    "3. Is the person married? Married people are coded \"1\" and everyone else is coded \"0\".\n",
    "4. Is the person a millennial? People born between 1980 and 1996 are coded \"1\" and those born in other years are coded \"0\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have probably already figured out, dummy variables are used primarily for data that is qualitative and cannot be ranked in any way. For example, being married is qualitative and \"married\" is neither higher nor lower than \"single\".  However, dummy variables sometimes also refer to variables that are qualitative and ranked, such as level of education, and sometimes for variables that are quantitative, such as age groupings. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that dummy variables must always be used when we want to include categorical (qualitative) variables in our analysis. These are variables such as sex, gender, race, marital status, religiosity, immigration status etc. Without creating dummy variables for these demographics, analysis of the results from data analysis, regression, and other research will not be meaningful, as we are working with variables which have been numerically scaled in an arbitrary way. This is especially true for interpreting the coefficients outputted from a regression."

Sometimes, the variables in a dataset have unrecognizable names, which may be confusing when conducting research. In these cases, it is a good idea to change them immediately. In your research, you will also be creating your own variables (like dummy variables) for qualitative measures and will want to be careful about giving them good names. This is especially important for generating tables, since you will want your tables to be easily legible in your paper.\n",
