    "##  5.2 Generating Dummy Variables\n",
    "The most common type of variable we will create during data cleaning and analysis is the dummy variable. Dummy variables are variables that can only take on two values: 0 and 1. It is useful to think of a dummy variable as being the answer to a question that can be answered \"yes\" or \"no\". With a dummy variable the answer yes is coded as \"1\" and no is coded as \"0\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of question that are used to create dummy variables can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is the person female? Females are coded \"1\" and males are coded \"0\".\n",
    "2. Does the person have a university degree? People with a university degree are coded \"1\" and everyone else is coded \"0\".\n",
    "3. Is the person married? Married people are coded \"1\" and everyone else is coded \"0\".\n",
    "4. Is the person a millennial? People born between 1980 and 1996 are coded \"1\" and those born in other years are coded \"0\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have probably already figured out, dummy variables are used primarily for data that is qualitative and cannot be ranked in any way. For example, being married is qualitative and \"married\" is neither higher nor lower than \"single\".  However, dummy variables sometimes also refer to variables that are qualitative and ranked, such as level of education, and sometimes for variables that are quantitative, such as age groupings. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that dummy variables must always be used when we want to include categorical (qualitative) variables in our analysis. These are variables such as sex, gender, race, marital status, religiosity, immigration status etc. Without creating dummy variables for these demographics, analysis of the results from data analysis, regression, and other research will not be meaningful, as we are working with variables which have been numerically scaled in an arbitrary way. This is especially true for interpreting the coefficients outputted from a regression."

This function creates different values for an input based on specified cases. Specifically, it consists of a series of lines, and each line gives a (i) case and (ii) value for that case. This function is nearly always used to operate on strings, or variables which do not have numerical significance in terms of how they are coded. Otherwise, we could use simple operators such as <, >, and = to classify values of these variables and then invoke the `ifelse` function as we did above. Unfortunately, we don't have any variables in our \"fake_data\" data set which call for this and we don't have an example fit for this function.
