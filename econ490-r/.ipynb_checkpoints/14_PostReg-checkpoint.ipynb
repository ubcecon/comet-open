    "Imagine that we have constructed a dependent variable which contains the earnings growth of individual workers and we see that some worker's earnings increased by more than 400%. We might wonder if this massive change is just a coding error made by the statisticians that produced the data set. Even without that type of error, though, we might worry that the earnings growth of small number of observations are a driving the results of our analysis. If this is the case, we would be producing an inaccurate analysis based on results that are not associated with the majority of our observations. \n",

    "Our regression analysis so far assumes that the relationship between our independent and explanatory variables is linear. If this is not the case, and the relationship is non-linear, then we are getting inaccurate results with our analysis. \n",

    "Let's consider an example. We know that earnings increases with age, but what if economic theory predicts that the amount that earnings increases for each year of age when workers are younger is larger than the amount that earnings increases for each year of age when workers are older? Another way to say this is, what if we predict that earnings is increasing with age at a decreasing rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could correct for this in our model by including a new interaction term that is simply age interacted with itself. You learned how to do this in [Module 13](). Let's include this in regression above remembering the age is a continuous variable "
