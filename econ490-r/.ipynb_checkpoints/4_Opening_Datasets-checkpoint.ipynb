    "We will start this project by focusing on loading and cleaning up our data-set: these are **fundamental** skills which will be necessary for essentially every data project we will do.  This process usually consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We load the data into R, meaning we take a file on our computer and tell R how to interpret it.\n",
    "2.  We clean up the data by removing missing variables or adjusting the way they are interpreted.\n",

    "Remember, before we can load the data we need to tell R what **packages** we will be using in the notebook. Without these packages, R will not have access to the appropriate functions needed to interpret our raw data.

    "### Changing Variable Names \n",
    "\n",
    "One optional step in our data cleaning process is changing the names of variables so they are easily accessible when producing research. More specifically, this means making all of our variable names short and descriptive. Many datasets from statistical agencies will have excellent variable names, so this is a conventional and helpful process to go through when we encounter a dataset with non-descriptive names. For instance, many older datasets have variables with names like `EDMM1928`, which are not terribly helpful!\n",

    "### Combining Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we will need to draw on data from multiple datasets. Most of the time, these datasets will be available for download in different files (each for a given year, month, country, etc.). For example, if we are working with macroeconomic data from Statistics Canada such as inflation rates, GDP, and population, data for these variables may be stored in different datasets corresponding to different years. Thus, if we want to compile them we need to combine them into the same data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key ways of combining data, each reflecting different goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  When we want to add more observations from another dataset into our existing dataset, we call this **appending** data.\n",
    "    * If you think of a dataset as a spreadsheet, this is like taking one dataset and \"pasting\" it into the bottom of a current dataset to add more observations. We do this when the observations from the other dataset have recorded data for all existing variables.\n",
    "2.  When we want to add new variables and their data from another dataset into our existing dataset, we call this **merging** data.\n",
    "    * This is like looking up values in a table and then adding a column; in Excel, this is called a `VLOOKUP`. Importantly, we can only merge data that share a common column or **key** to  identify observations with particular values. For example, if we want to merge in data from a different year but for the same people (observations) as those we are currently working with, datasets will usually have an identifying number for the person that functions as our key. In this dataset, every individual is identified by their `ppsort` number, so this is the key we would use to merge in new variables. "

This was an example of a simple 1:1 (one-to-one) merge since there was a perfect match between the number of observations in both datasets. In this way, there were no extra observations in either. However, this will not often be the case. Suppose we only had half of the `ppsort` IDS in our more_census_data dataframe. When merging, we could have then chosen to create our merged dataframe with only those `ppsort` who can find a \"match\" in both datasets. We could do this with the `left_join()` or `right_join()` functions, using the former if our first specified dataset was census_data and the latter if our second specified dataset was census_data within the brackets of the function. If we instead had some observations in each dataset which did not have a match (the `ppsort` ID did not match) and we didn't want to lose these observations, we could use the `full_join()` option to retain all observations within both datasets in our final dataframe. Finally, if we wanted only those observations which had matching `ppsort` IDs across both datasets, we could use the `inner_join()` function, returning us a smaller dataset. This is implicitly what we did in our merge above; however, since all observations in both datasets matched on `ppsort`, we didn't lose anything.
