        "    the underlying variables in a simple way anymore.\n",
        "2.  The second reason is that it’s easy to make mistakes. You might\n",
        "    define the interaction incorrectly (possible!). However, it’s more\n",
        "    of an issue if later on you change the underlying variables and then\n",
