        "statistics classes. We used one sample of test scores, and used the\n",
        "*analytical method* and assumptions about the underlying population to\n",
        "compute a single 95% confidence interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall how we used both the standard error (using the sample standard\n",
        "deviation and sample size) and critical value (obtained through\n",
        "$t$-distribution) to finally get the margin of error? Thus the idea of\n",
        "*variability around the mean* is essential to the process of\n",
        "constructing a 95% confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "We introduced an important concept in Part 2 - the theoretical framework\n",
        "of the Sampling Distribution of Sample Means. Easily imagined as the\n",
        "distribution of *all possible sample means* that can be generated from\n",
        "the original population, this distribution of sample means is useful for\n",
        "both Confidence Intervals construction and Hypothesis Testing, as you\n",
        "will learn in further tutorials.\n",
        "\n",
        "Part 3 is where the real fun began. We took note of the fact that\n",
        "obtaining the actual sampling distribution is unfeasible in the real\n",
        "world. So, we instead used a popular method used in the Data Sciences –\n",
        "the bootstrapping method. We essentially “replicated” samples out of a\n",
        "single sample, generating a sampling distribution that is centered at\n",
        "the original sample’s mean. We then used this “bootstrapped” sampling\n",
        "distribution to get the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile values for the\n",
        "average sample scores to finally obtain the 95% Confidence Interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, we compared the 3 intervals and found that they all captured the\n",
