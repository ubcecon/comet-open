    "* Each column represents a single variable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine this as a spreadsheet in a program like Excel.  This is the way most statistical programs like to recieve data - but it _isn't_ a property of the data itself.  It is only a representation; there can be other kinds of representations.  For example, a panel dataset might have each row as a unit (e.g. country) and each column might represent a variable in a year (e.g. unemployment in 2016, unemployment in 2017, etc.).  Often, when we work with real-world data we have to reshape it in order for it to be usable - but in this course, we won't worry about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be stored in many different file formats, which must be interpreted by our statistical programs. For example, data files with a `.dta` are formatted for Stata,  data files with a `.csv` suffix are formatted as comma-seperated values, and data files with an `.Rda` suffix are formatted for R. This is referred to as **importing** data. Essentially, we need to tell them what the data means. There are different methods for importing data in different formats; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `read_dta()`: Importing data from a ```.dta``` file: this is data that was created by the statistical software STATA and is commonly used in economics.\n",
    "* `read.csv()`: Importing data from a delimited text file: this is data which is in a text format, but where the columns are *delimited* or seperated by a special character.  For example, the ```.csv``` (comma-separated variable) format is text, but where the columns are separated by a comma.\n",
    "* `load()`: Importing data from a ```.Rda``` file: this is data that was created by the statistical software R and is commonly used in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these formats has a special **method** associated with it.  Methods are commands, stored in R packages, that tell R to do things.  In fact, you're already seen one!  The ```library(...)``` method imports whatever package is in the brackets into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing our ```.dta``` file into memory, using the ```read_dta``` method.  When we read things into memory, we normally want to use them later, so we have to give them a name.  Let's call this ```SFS_data``` so we can refer to it later on:"

Females are an important part of workforce. But studies show that there is gender income gap and gender wealth gap. What factors contribute to the gender gap? Here we are going to explore the wealth gap between male lead households and female lead households (a male lead households is a household in which  a male earns the majority of the income). \n",

    "The first question we should ask ourselves is: is there a significant gap between male lead household wealth and female lead household wealth? A different way to ask this, is given our data, what percent of the time would we except this gap to appear randomly? This describes a p-value, so first we will perform a t-test, to get this value. Now if this p-value indicates a significant gap in wealth, we can go on to ask what is causing this wealth gap.\n",

    "* Female lead households and male lead household, different saving and investment habits. For instance male lead households might take on more risk, or holds less cash than female lead households. \n",

    "* Female lead households inherit less wealth (regardless of income), or \n",
    "\n",
    "* Female lead households face additional obstacles in regard to building wealth, for instance access to credit.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be going through this topic for the next three modules, in this one will see if there is a significant wealth gap, and what causes it, which may involve investigating the income gap, between male and female lead households. First of all, we're going to compute the average family wealth. Then we compute the average family wealth conditional on being a female lead household vs a male lead households. Next we will do a t-test to see if the wealth gap is significant. Finally, we will briefly investigate what is causing the wealth gap."
