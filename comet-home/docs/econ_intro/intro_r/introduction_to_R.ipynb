If you are familiar with other programming languages, such as Python, this will likely be very familiar - if this is your first time, don't be intimidated!  Try to play around with the examples and exercises as you work through this notebook; it's easiest to learn R (or any programming language) by playing around with it."

    "## Basic Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, it's important to get a good grasp of the different **data types** in R and how to use them.  Whenever with work with R, we will be manipulating different kinds of information, which is referred to as \"data\".  Data comes in many different forms, which define how we can use it in calculations or visualizations - these are called _types_ in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "R has 6 basic data types. Data types are used to store information about a variable or object in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Character**: data in text format, like \"word\" or \"abc\"\n",
    "2. **Numeric** (real or decimal): data in real number format, like 6, or 18.8 (referred to as **Double** in R)\n",
    "3. **Integer**:  data in an whole number (integer) format, like 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)\n",
    "4. **Logical**: truth values, like TRUE, FALSE\n",
    "5. **Complex**: data in complex (i.e. imaginary) format, like 1+6i (where $i$ is the $\\sqrt{-1}$)\n",
    "6. **Raw**: raw digital data, which is unusual which we will not cover in this section\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are ever wondering what kind of type an object in R has, or what its properties are, we can use the following two functions, which allow us to examine the data type and elements contained within an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `typeof()`: this function returns a character string that corresponds to the data type of an object \n",
    "* `str()`: this function displays a compact internal structure of an R object \n",

    "Basic data is fine, but we often need to store data in more complex forms.  Data can also be stored in different structures in R beyond basic data types. Data structures in R programming can be complicated, as they are tools for holding multiple values. However, some of them are very important, and are worth discussing here. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vectors**: a vector of values, like $(1,3,5,7)$\n",
    "* **Matrices**: a matrix of values, like $[1,2; 3,4]$ (usually displayed as a square)\n",
    "* **Lists**: a list of elements, like $($pet = \"cat, \"dog\", \"mouse\"$)$, with named properties\n",
    "* **Dataframe**: a collection of vectors or lists, organized into rows and columns according to observations.\n",

In your project, although the functionality of the method `a + b` is obvious, it may be unclear what this operation's purpose is in your project. Your readers or other developers may ask: why did you use addition instead of multiplication or division? With comments, you can explain why this particular method was used for this particular code block and how it relates to other code blocks. \n",

    "Generally, it is always a good idea to add comments to your code. However, if you find yourself needing to explain a block of code in great detail in terms of its purpose in the project, it is preferable to use a markdown cell instead. Comments are best served for the reasons above."

    "\n",
    "* **Syntax errors**: This is the most common error type. They result from invalid code statements/structures that R doesn’t understand. Suppose R speaks English, asking it to help by speaking German or broken English certainly would not work! Here are some examples of common syntax errors: the associated package is not loaded, misspelling of a command as R is chase-sensitive, unmatched parenthesis etc. How we handle syntax errors is case-by-case: we can usually solve syntax errors by reading the error message and googling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semantic errors**: They result from valid code that successfully executes but produces unintended outcomes. Again, let us suppose R speaks English. Although you asked it to hand you an apple in English and R successfully understood, but then handed you a banana! This is not okay! How we handle semantic errors is also case-by-case: we can usually solve semantic errors by reading the error message and googling it."
