    "## Introduction to Statistical Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to begin with the fundamental problem of statistical inference. Let's start with a **population**, which is commonly defined as the complete collection of all individuals or entities we are studying. From here, we want to determine a particular characteristic of the population, the **population parameter**. For example, if we want to determine the average height of a Canadian resident, our population would be every Canadian resident and our population parameter would be average height. Imagine how easy life would be for economists if we had access to any population parameter we desired. If we had perfect data from our population, we would be able to determine the average returns to education, the impact of stimulus checks for every resident, and so much more with absolute certainty all by surveying every member of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately collecting data from the entire population is often too expensive and impractical. A more realistic way to find what we're looking is to survey a **sample**, a subset of individuals or entities from the population. Through this sample, we can gather a **sample estimate**, an estimate of the population parameter from our sample. From our example, it would be much more practical to survey a 1000 people in Canada and calculate their average height. Evidently, this won't exactly the match the true average height of a Canadian resident, because we haven't based our calculation off every Canadian resident, but it's probably a good estimate. But how do we know we picked a representative sample of the Canadian population?\n"

    "## Simple Random Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "A **simple random sample** is a subset of a population, in which each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. It's important that this condition is met when selecting a sample. Imagine if we try to determine the average height of the Canadian population by only sampling professional athletes. We wouldn't get a very good estimate of our population parameter. Simple random samples allow us to create sample parameters, which are **unbiased estimators** of the population parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two statistical approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We could conduct a census. To do this, we would need to measure the height of all 38 million people living in Canada. This technique produces little error, but comes at a very high cost.  Moreover, we may not actually be able to collect all of this data - what if we miss someone?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We could take a **simple random sample** of the Canadian population, in which all 38 million Canadians have an equal probability of being chosen. This would allow us to make **statistical inferences** on the population mean, without the cost of conducting a census. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: It's important to keep in mind that there are other types of sampling in economics.  Simple random sampling is just a good starting point for our discussion! In econometrics, it is crucial that we try to get as close as possible to an unbiased estimator through a random sample. Imagine if we are trying to determine the gender pay gap in British Columbia and we only take a sample from those living in downtown Vancouver or we only took a sample from those working in blue collar jobs. That wouldn't give us very accurate results. You will learn more about this in ECON 326."

    "## Simulating Data\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be helpful in this notebook to work with **simulated data**. We can simulate data by drawing from some well known distributions such as normal and uniform. Before we begin simulating data to work with, we need to be familar the concept of a **random number seed**. Setting a random number seed allows us to reproduce results drawn from a distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R and all programming languages, random numbers are not truly random, they are known as **pseudo-random numbers**. R uses a random number generator that produces a sequence of numbers that are completely determined by a seed value - they are effectively random, but also reproducible. Once you set the seed value using the `set.seed` function, everything after that point may look random, but is actually totally reproducible. For example, if you were to pick a random sample out of a 100,000 data points, every time we ran the code we would get a different random sample. You would never be able to check the work of your classmates or ever attain the same results again. By using the same seed before conducting our analyses, we are able to reproduce the results we attained earlier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "See [this reference](https://datasciencebook.ca/classification2.html#randomseeds) for more information on how the `set.seed()` function achieves reproducible randomness in R."

    "## Repeated Random Samples and Sampling Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that when we survey a sample, we are only observing a subset of the population and determining a sample estimate based off that sample. If we surveyed a different 1000 Canadian residents every time, we would certainly get a different estimate for the average height of a Canadian resident. Let's assume for now that we can draw many samples of size $n$ from our normal distribution population. Every time we draw a new sample, we will get a different estimate of the mean. Now, if we were to plot each of those estimates onto a histogram, we would get a **sampling distribution**. A sampling distribution of a statistic is a probability distribution based on repeated independent samples of size $n$ from a population of size $N$. Using the example introduced above, we can produce a distribution of sample means, based on repeated and independent simple random samples from our population. If we take enough samples, we will find that the mean of the sampling distribution will be nearly equal the mean of our population distribution (our population parameter). Amazing, isn't it? With an infinite number of random samples, the mean of the sampling distribution will be exactly equal to the population parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are more interested in the effect of increasing sample size. We will find that with larger and larger samples sizes, the standard error of the sampling distribution decreases. In other words, in a given sample of a larger sized $n$, the probability of having a sample estimate far away from the true population parameter decreases. This is a very important concept in statistical inference and econometrics.   \n",

    "\n",
    "We will need to take $R$ independent simple random samples of size $n$ from our `population` of size $N$, to produce our sampling distribution ($R$ observations). To do this in R, we will need to take a simple random sample of size $n$, compute the sample mean, and store it in a vector. We will then repeat this $R$ times, appending each sample mean into our vector. Our vector, in this case, will represent the observations of our sampling distribution!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the **standard error** as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The standard error will inform us on how much our sample mean will vary from sample to sample. For this exercise, we will keep the number of samples constant and progressively increase our sample size to see how it affects the standard error of the sampling distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `rep_sample_n` function from the `infer` package in R. This function allows us to repeatedly take samples from a population. The `size` parameter indicates the sample size and the `reps` parameter indicates the number of samples we wish to draw from our population. The solid blue line represents the true mean of the normal distribution population (0) and the dashed red line shows us the mean of the sampling distribution. Given that we are taking many samples, these two values should be very similar."

However, we varied our sample sizes. It's important to notice that as we increased our samples size, the standard error decreased. As a reminder, having a low standard error means that the probability of having a sample produce a sample estimate that is far away from the true population parameter is very low. In the previous examples with a sample size of 500, we can see that the sample means are mostly between -0.1 and +0.1. With a sample size of 5, the sample means are mostly between -1 and 1. \n",

We had to first have access to the population and draw hundreds of samples from that population to make a sampling distribution. This is impossible for multiple reasons (1) we almost never access to the entire population (2) drawing two samples of 10 individuals is the same as drawing one sample of 20. Naturally, you may have been wondering how economists calculate the standard error of their sample estimates. One common technique is **bootstrapping** samples."

In order to draw a bootstrap sample, we pick 1 ball out of the bag ten times while allowing replacement. We take out the first ball, note whether it's a red or green ball, then put it back in the bag and repeat the process 9 more times to arrive at our bootstrap sample.
