    "In this notebook, we will continue learning about how to use descriptive statistics to represent sets of data. We've already seen how to compute measures of central tendency and determine which measures are appropriate for given situations. We'll now focus on computing measures of dispersion and dependence in order to better understand both the variation of variables, as well as relationships between variables in a data set. We'll dedicate time to both measures, but we'll look at dispersion first. Let's first import our familiar 2016 Census data set from Statistics Canada."

    "## Understanding Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of dispersion describe the spread of data, that is, the possible values that a variable in a data set can take on. Common measures of dispersion which we'll look at include the range, interquartile range, standard deviation and variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Range and Interquartile Range\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen the range and interquartile range in the _Central Tendency_ notebook. Remember, the **range** is the difference between the maximum and minimum value that a variable takes on, while the **interquartile range** is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile values. We can use functions like `quantile()` and `fivenum()` to calculate these statistics quite quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions return the same output: a list that includes the minimum value, 25th percentile, 50th percentile (median), 75th percentile, and maximum value. In this way, these commands allow us to construct a snapshot of both the spread of the middle 50% of data around the median (the interquartile range), as well as the spread of the data in its entirely (the range).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance \n",
    "\n",
    "The **variance** is the average of the squared differences from the mean. A small variance indicates that observations tend to fall close to the mean, while a high variance indicates that observations are very spread out from the mean. The standard deviation (discussed next) is also the square root of variance, we we won't spend much time on variance here. \n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, a normal distribution with `mean = 30` and `sd = 5` is exactly the same thing as a normal distribution with `mean = 30` and `variance = 25`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference between the two is that the variance is a squared measure and does not have the _same units_ as the data in the way that the standard deviation does; hence why we usually work with standard deviation instead."

For instance, an estimate of the population variance based on a sample size of 100 certainly has more information than a sample size of 10. The degrees of freedom is the amount of information an estimate has. The degrees of freedom for an estimate is equal to the number of observations minus the number of parameters we would like to estimate. Thus, the degrees of freedom of our estimate of variance (sample variance) is equal to *n - 1*."

    "that most of the Canadians in the dataset have a wage which lies approximately \\\\$64275.27 away from the mean of \\\\$54482.52. \n",
    "\n",
    "This large standard deviation tells us that there is high variation between wage observations and that some of them are spread out very far from the mean, suggesting we have it is likely we have a lot of outliers in the dataset (this is common for wage distribution in the presence of income inequality). This brings us to a general rule: the standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close to the mean, while the standard deviation is large when the data are spread out away from the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Empirical Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall again from the _Central Tendency_ notebook that data often approximately follow a normal distribution (symmetrical distribution wherein the mean value is also the median). For a variable with values distributed in this way, there is a standard when discussing their standard deviation. We say that about 68% of these values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean, about 95% are within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and about 99.7% are within 3 standard deviations from the mean. Remaining observations are extreme outliers and incredibly rare. This is called the **68-95-99.7 rule or Empirical Rule**, and is visualized in the diagram below."

    "This gives us a helpful frame of reference when discussing the standard deviation of a variable. Although we already saw that the `wages` variable follows a relatively skewed distribution, we can imagine a variable that doesn't, say test scores. If the mean score on a test is 70 and the standard deviation is 10, this tells us that approximately 68% of students who wrote that test earned a score between 60 and 80 (1 standard deviation), approximately 95% earned a score between 50 and 90 (2 standard deviations) and virtually everyone earned a score between 40 and 100 (3 standard deviations)."
