```{dropdown} • Colby Chambers
My name is Colby and I’m a fourth year undergraduate student in the honours economics program at the University of British Columbia. I joined this project out of an interest for course development stimulated through work as a TA in the mathematics department, as well as a desire to improve my R skills.  In the COMET project, I have contributed to a variety of notebooks for ECON 325. I have also helped adapt ECON 490 notebooks from Stata to R. During my time with the project, I have seen firsthand the value that graduate and undergraduate students can bring to providing informative, digestible material to students. I am delighted to know that undergraduate students will benefit from the material we have created.
My economic interests include exploring how to promote group cohesion in the workplace and address discrimination more generally. On campus, I have been involved with the Science Peer Academic Coaches, the Iona Journal of Economics, and UBC Conservatives. Off campus, I volunteer for the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism, a charity which promotes an open, non-partisan approach to the issues above. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and expanding my geographic knowledge through any platform I can find.

Hi I’m Anneke (she/they) and I am a mixed Dutch and Scottish/Ukrainian-Canadian settler working and learning on unceded Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh lands. I’m currently a fifth year undergraduate studying Visual Art, Economics, Informatics and Business Management at the University of British Columbia. I join this project from my background in user experience design and from my research experience in data justice methodologies during my time with UBC’s Collective for Gender+ in Research.
My contribution to the COMET project centres around beginner-level R learning materials for summary statistics and data visualization which will be used in UBC’s ECON 325: Introduction to Empirical Economics course. I’m interested in how data science can be used as a tool for a more just world and have enjoyed using my interdisciplinary perspective to invite econometrics learners to consider how socio-technical and socio-political dimensions complicate empirical processes.
In my spare time I enjoy being with mountains and forests and can often be found making plant-based food or having a splashing time in aquafit classes at the UBC pool.
